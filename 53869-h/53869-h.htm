</div>

<p class='c009'>There is a widespread opinion that all study of the
mode of oratory is unmanly, and leads to the substitution
of artifice and adornment for simplicity and power.
“Let a man have something important to say,” it is
argued, “and he need not waste his time in trying to
find how to say it.” So general is this sentiment, that a
ministerial acquaintance of the writer’s was recently very
careful to conceal from his congregation the fact that he
was taking a series of lessons in elocution, lest his influence
should be diminished.</p>

<p class='c000'>We may admit that the popular prejudice against the
study of eloquence is not without a mixture of reason.
It is possible to foster a spurious kind of oratory, which
shall be far inferior to the rudest genuine speech. But,
on the other hand, it is safe to maintain that every
rational power man possesses can be strengthened by
judicious cultivation, without in the least impairing its
quality. There is no trick in true oratory—no secret
magic by which a weak-minded man can become the
leader of others stronger and wiser than himself. The
great prizes of eloquence cannot be placed in the hands
of the ignorant or slothful. But so surely as a raw apprentice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>can be transformed into a skillful workman, any
person possessed of ordinary faculties, who will pay the
price in labor, can be made master of the art of ready
and forcible public utterance.</p>

<p class='c000'>The methods of oratorical cultivation presented in this
volume are not based upon mere theory. They have
been tested in hundreds of instances, and their results are
beyond question. A carpenter will assert with perfect
assurance, “I guarantee to take an ordinary young man,
who will place himself in my hands for a reasonable
time, and turn him out a thorough mechanic, master of
every part of his trade.” The effects of training are as
marvelous and as certain in the fields of eloquence.</p>

<p class='c000'>But this training must necessarily combine practice
with theory. To study about great orators and observe
their works is not sufficient. Here again, we may take
a lesson from the mode in which an apprentice is trained.
The master architect does not take his young men to
gaze upon finished buildings, and expect them, from
mere admiration and architectural fervor, to construct
similar works. He would soon find that not one in a
hundred had the “mechanical genius” for such an easy
triumph. But he takes them into the shop, where work
is in progress, places before them some simple task, and
from that leads them on, step by step, to more difficult
achievements. They learn how to make the separate
parts of a house, and afterward how to fit those parts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>into a complete work. Under this rational mode of instruction
the great majority master the whole business
placed before them, and the failures are rare exceptions.
If similar success does not attend oratorical students, the
explanation must be sought, not in the nature of oratory,
but in wrong methods of training. Merely reading
Cicero and Demosthenes, even in their original tongues,
declaiming choice selections, or listening to great orators,
will not make any one eloquent, unless indeed he possesses
that rare natural genius which rises above all
rules and sweeps away every obstacle.</p>

<p class='c000'>But it must be remembered that there are many degrees
of eloquence. The popular conception is somewhat
unjust in refusing recognition to those who possess this
power in only a fair degree. It is not possible by any
mode of training to produce many orators of the very
highest type. Such will ever be rare for the same reason
that there are but few great poets, generals, or statesmen.
But proper education in the art of speech should enable
a man to give full, free, and adequate expression to whatever
thoughts and feelings he may possess. It may go
further, and make him more fruitful in thought, and
more intense in feeling, than he could have been in the
absence of such education, and he may thus become fairly
entitled to the rewards of eloquence without, however,
reaching the level of the few great world-orators. The
distinction between a good degree of practical, working
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>eloquence, which may be successfully taught to the mass
of students, and the very highest development of the
same faculty, should always be kept in mind. Even the
mightiest genius may be regulated, strengthened, and
directed by culture; while moderate talents may, by
similar culture, reach a very serviceable degree of efficiency
and power.</p>

<p class='c000'>While these considerations appear almost self-evident,
they are not unnecessary. On listening to a true orator—one
who, without hesitation, pours forth a stream of
well-chosen words, and develops a difficult subject in a
clear and masterly manner—we are apt to receive an
impression like that made by the operation of a law of
nature, or an unerring animal instinct. Does the orator
acquire eloquence as the bee learns to construct honey-cells?
There is, no doubt, a foundation for eloquence in
natural ability, but the analogy is far more close with
the human builder, who sees mentally the image of the
house he wishes to construct, fits the various timbers and
other materials into their places, and works intelligently
until his conception is realized. To Jack Cade and his
fellows the mysteries of reading and writing “came by
nature;” but experience has shown that this much of
nature can be developed in the great majority of American
children. In the moderate and reasonable meaning of
the term, eloquence can be made almost as general as the
elements of a common-school education. The child that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>masters the art of reading, really makes a greater conquest
over difficulties, than the average well-educated
youth needs to add to the stores he already possesses, in
order to attain a good degree of oratorical power. There
are, indeed, a few indispensable requisites which will be
understood by every person; but the want of these
debars a small minority only, and their absence is easily
recognized. For all others the path of success lies open.
Patient practice in the use of the pen as a servant but
not as a master, the study of good models, and the
laborious mastery in detail of the separate elements of
oratory, will not fail of abundant fruit.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are two classes of works with which this treatise
should not be confounded. It aims to occupy an almost
vacant place between manuals of elocution on the one
hand, and works of technical instruction in the various
oratorical professions, on the other. Both of these classes
of books are very useful, and teach indirectly many of
the elements of true eloquence. Elocution deals with
voice and gesture, which are prime elements in oratory;
and although it is popularly supposed to be applicable
only to reading and recitation, it is equally serviceable in
off-hand speech. Works of the second class give rules
for preaching, debating, pleading at the bar, teaching,
and all other professions which involve public speech.
They show how various kinds of discourses may be constructed,
but have few practical directions about the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>mode of delivery, or that grand and noble work—the
development of the oratorical power itself.</p>

<p class='c000'>This book is written from the standpoint of the student
who wishes to wield the golden sceptre of eloquence and
is willing to put forth all reasonable efforts to that end.
It will aim to guide him into the right path; show him
what helps are available, and what discipline is necessary;
encourage him in overcoming difficulties, and stimulate
him to seek the very highest excellence within the compass
of his faculties.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>The Four Methods of Public Speech—Their Advantages and Disadvantages.</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“What shall I do?” exclaims the young student who
expects soon to face public audiences. “Shall I write
out what I have to say, polish it as highly as possible,
and then utter this finished product? Or must I take
the risk of being able to say nothing at all, in hope of
gaining the ease and naturalness of spontaneous speech?”</p>

<p class='c000'>It must be admitted that the first course indicated
above has many advantages, and seems in harmony with
the marked tendency of civilization toward division of
labor. It is hard to perform several different operations
at the same moment. Look how heavily the extempore
speaker is burdened. He must think of his subject;
arrange his ideas, sentences, and words; remember quotations;
originate proper tones and gestures; and keep
his attention closely fixed upon his audience. All this
he must do with the utmost promptness and regularity,
or incur a fearful penalty—that of embarrassment and
failure. Few men have the courage to stand long before
an audience, waiting for a missing word or idea. To
avoid this danger the mind of an extempore speaker
must be accustomed to work with the rapidity and precision
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>of a printing-press; otherwise, the appalling
danger of failure and ridicule will constantly stare him
in the face. It is not wonderful that such perils have
made many speakers perpetual slaves of the pen.</p>

<p class='c000'>But it may be noted that the public reader has an
equal number of things to do at the same moment. He
must look on the manuscript and recognize the words—a
complicated process, which practice has made easy, but
which does greatly distract attention. The whole discourse
must be brought into mind as really as if extemporized
with the difference that now, instead of arising
from within, it is brought back from without—a much
more difficult achievement. Tones and gestures are also
increasingly difficult. The reader will usually wish to give
some attention to the audience, which, with manuscript
before him, will be far from easy. After he has done
his best his hearers will think, “This man is reading,
not speaking—giving us what he thought yesterday or
last week, not what he is thinking now.” Possibly
this will not diminish their pleasure, but the sentiment
needs to be recognized.</p>

<p class='c000'>The resource of memorizing the discourse after it has
been prepared relieves the eye and lessens the physical
distraction, but it throws an additional and very heavy
burden upon the mind, and introduces new embarrassments
peculiar to itself.</p>

<p class='c000'>The advice enforced in these pages will be: “Extemporize;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>take the risk; fail, if necessary” though precautions
will be given making failure well nigh impossible;
“but in all cases when you speak to the people with the
object of convincing or persuading, let it be seen that
you speak directly the thoughts and feelings of that
very moment.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The two extremes of verbal communication between
men are letters, books, or essays, on the one side, and
desultory talk on the other. In the one, the pen is
everything; in the other, it is not employed at all.
Neither mode of address constitutes oratory, but the
whole field of this art lies between them.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are four principal methods of discourse distinguished
in reference to the mode of delivery, which

    </dl>

<p class='c000'>Of these, the first two have the great advantage of
allowing the speaker as much time as may be necessary
for the arrangement of the speech down to the minutest
detail. Words may be selected with the nicest care, and
if the first effort is not satisfactory the speech may be
written again and again, until the writer’s full power has
been utilized. After delivery, the manuscript is at once
available for publication or preservation. The first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>method gives the orator something to lean upon. Should
he become embarrassed, he can fix his attention closely
upon his writing until he recovers. Should his attention
be distracted, and the thread of discourse be broken, it
can be taken up again at any point.</p>

<p class='c000'>In recitation more declamatory fervor is possible than
in reading. Gesticulation is less restrained. The speaker
need not be confined within the narrow limits of a circle,
the centre of which is his manuscript, and the radius the
distance at which he can read it.</p>

<p class='c000'>As an offset, there is the effort, in some cases very considerable,
of memorizing; the variable power of memory
in different states of health; and the possibility of altogether
forgetting the prepared words. It must also be
admitted that few men can declaim well. Some have
mastered the difficult art, and have won laurels in this
way; but their number, especially in the modern world,
is comparatively small.</p>

<p class='c000'>Extemporizing does not exclude the most exhaustive
study of a subject. It is easier, indeed, to write upon a
subject only partially understood, than to address an
audience directly upon the same topic. Neither does
this method exclude the most careful pre-arrangement of
the thoughts enunciated. The trained speaker will find
it comparatively easy to make a plan at a moment’s
notice which will serve as a basis for discourse; but he
will usually be provided with a plan long before he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>begins to speak. He will aim to understand his subject,
make the best arrangement of it in his power, select what
is most fitting for his purpose, and then, face to face
with his audience, will give them, in a manly way, the
outflowing of his mind and heart. It is in this sense
alone that the word “extempore” will be used in this
volume. We maintain that, so far from being the refuge
of ignorance and sloth, extempore speech is often the
vehicle of the widest culture and the most extensive
knowledge.</p>

<p class='c000'>The increased attention paid to extempore speech
within a few years indicates a hopeful improvement of
taste among professional men. The majority of the
people have always preferred it. They do not greatly
desire of pulpit, platform, or bar, the verbal elaboration
favored by written speech; but fervent manner, earnest
conviction, and directness are highly prized. Readers
and reciters imitate, as far as they can, the manner of
spontaneous speech. It is well to remember that this
tribute of imitation is never paid by the superior to the
inferior.</p>

<p class='c000'>One argument in favor of extempore delivery has
never received due consideration: it is far more healthful
than other forms of address. In the case of men who
speak only at long intervals, this consideration may not
be weighty; but to others, it involves years of added
usefulness, or even life itself.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>This superior healthfulness has often been observed,
but what is its source? The answer will go far to show
why true extempore speech is more persuasive and emotional
than any other variety. In chemistry, a law
of affinity has long been recognized, according to which
substances just set free from combination have greater
energy, and are more ready to form new combinations,
than ever afterward. In the same way, voice and gesture
readily respond to <em>nascent</em> emotion; that is, to emotion
aroused for the first time. Every speaker who utters
the thought of the moment, if not fettered by bad habits,
or paralyzed by fear, will exhibit a perpetual change of
position, a variety of muscular movement, and a play of
expression which he can never afterward reproduce.
The pitch, rate, and force of the voice are controlled in
the same effective and almost automatic manner. An
ordinary extemporizer, when thoroughly aroused, will
employ as great a variety of tones and gestures as a
highly trained elocutionist in his most elaborate recitations.
Nothing is asserted as to the skill of the combinations,
the melody of the voice, or the grace of the action;
though even in these the advantage is not always on the
side of the elocutionist. But in distributing the effort
among all the organs, and in giving that alternate rest
and action upon which health and strength depend, the
elocutionist may strive in vain to equal the model set him
by a good extempore speech. In Western and seaside
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>camp-meetings, speakers who have never spent an hour
in vocal drill will often address thousands of people in the
open air with an energy of voice and manner that would,
if employed over a manuscript by any other than the most
accomplished elocutionist, speedily bring all efforts and
the speaker himself to an end. But he easily endures
the strain because there is that continual change which
is the equivalent of rest. Notice some thoroughly excited
speaker, trained only in the school of experience—possibly
a mere demagogue or popular agitator—at his
work. A word shot forth almost as piercing as a steam
whistle is followed by a sentence far down the scale, and
when emotion demands the same high key again, the
organs in that position are fresh for a new ear-piercing
effort. There is equal variation in the rate of speech.
The whole body joins in the expression of emotion, without
the slightest conscious effort, impelled only by the
aroused nervous energy which seeks that mode of discharge.
When the effort ends, the man is weary, indeed;
but with a weariness distributed over the whole body, and
without a trace of that exhaustion of brain, throat, or the
upper part of the lungs, which has sent many manuscript
speakers—clergymen, especially—to untimely graves.</p>

<p class='c000'>What a difference there is between the preacher who
languidly reads his manuscript for twenty-five minutes
to a hundred people, and closes the mighty effort with
aching head, quivering nerves, and exhausted throat, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>the typical camp-meeting orator! The latter works hard,
addressing thousands of people for an hour and a half
or two hours; but as the stamping foot, the tense arm,
the nodding head, the fully expanded lungs, and the
swaying body have all taken part, the blood and nervous
energy have been sent in due proportion to every organ,
and there is no want of balance. The man can repeat
the same performances the next day, and continue it, as
many itinerants have done, for months together. Similar
examples of endurance have often been given in heated
political canvasses by orators of the very highest eminence,
as well as by others unknown to fame. Difference
of cultivation or of earnestness will not suffice to explain
the contrast between the two classes of speakers.</p>

<p class='c000'>The chemical analogy is instructive, and goes far to
account for the observed differences. When thought
passes out of the mist and shadow of general conceptions
into the definite form of words, it has immeasurably
greater power to arouse and agitate the mind in which
this transformation is made, than it can have when the
same words are merely recalled in memory or read from
a sheet of paper. When the whole process of expression
takes place at once:—the mental glance over the subject;
the coinage of thoughts into words and sentences; the
utterance of the words as they rise to the lips; the selection
of key, inflection, emphasis, gesture:—the man must
have a very cold nature, or his theme be very dull, if,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>with a sympathizing audience before him, the tides of
emotion do not begin to swell. But notice how other
modes of delivery squander this wealth of emotion. The
writer carefully elaborates his language. He is perfectly
calm, or if there is any excitement, it is purely intellectual,
and the quickened flow of blood is directed only
to the brain. When the ardor of composition subsides,
and he reviews his pages, the fire seems to have died out
of them. While memorizing, or making himself familiar
enough with what he has written to read it with effect,
he may recall some of the first ardor, but only to have
it again subside. When at last he stands up to speak,
his production is a thrice-told tale. In but few cases
will he feel the full inspiration of his message. If he
recites, the effort of memory distracts his attention, and
he is probably reading from a page of manuscript presented
by his mental vision. If he reads directly, he
must take a position to see his paper, and at least part of
the time keep his eye fixed upon it. The address is
felt to come, notwithstanding all the artifice he can
employ, at least as much from the paper as from the
man. The most profound culture in reading and declamation
only suffices to bring back part of the emotion
with which the genuine extemporizer starts.</p>

<p class='c000'>As bearing upon the subject of the healthfulness of
extempore speech, a reference to the writer’s own experience
may not be improper. Severe and exceptional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>hardship in the civil war led to a complete break-down
in health. The hope of any kind of active work, or
even of many months of life, seemed very slight. The
question was not so much how to speak best, as how to
speak at all. Fortunately, a long series of daily lectures,
involving no great intellectual effort, proved that mere
talking was not necessarily hurtful. Some elocutionary
hints at the right time were also of great value. When
the pulpit was entered, greater difficulty arose. A few
trials of memorized preaching produced alarming nervous
exhaustion. Reading was equally deleterious to throat
and voice. One path alone seemed open; and entering
upon that with confidence, which eighteen years of experience
has only deepened, the writer found that extempore
speech was, for him, probably the most healthful
of all forms of exercise. It is not likely that one-third
of this term of work would have been secured by any
other kind of address.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another important advantage is the saving of time
afforded by this mode of speech. The hours otherwise
wasted in word-elaboration may be more usefully employed
in general studies. The field for an orator’s improvement
is boundless; but if obliged to fully write a
large number of discourses, he must either work very
rapidly or very perseveringly to enter far into that field.
But if less preparation is given to individual speeches,
more time will be available for the improvement of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>speaker. Or if he uses the same length of preparation
for each discourse in the extempore mode, he can collect
and classify a far greater amount of material, and the
mental element will thus gain far more than the merely
verbal loses.</p>

<p class='c000'>Only the fourth or composite method of discourse
remains for our consideration. At first glance, it seems
to combine the advantages of all other methods, and for
many minds it possesses great attraction. In it the less
important parts of the speech are given off-hand, while
passages of especial brilliancy or power are written fully,
and either read or recited. Added variety may be given
by reading some of these, and declaiming others from
memory. A very brilliant and showy discourse may
thus be constructed. But the difficulties are also very
great. Full success requires a rare combination of desirable
qualities. A good verbal memory, the power of
composing effective fragments, and of declaiming or
reading them well, are not often joined to all the qualities
that make a ready and impressive extemporizer. For
this reason it usually follows that in composite discourses
one of the elements so greatly predominates as to dwarf
the others. A manuscript discourse in which an extempore
remark or two is interpolated must be classed with
written discourses. Neither does extemporizing lose its
special character, though some scattered quotations be
read or repeated from memory. To pick up a book, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>the midst of a speech, and read a theme or argument, or
the statement of another’s position, does not make the
discourse composite in character, unless such reading be
the principal part of it. An eloquent speaker on one
occasion occupied more than half his time, and produced
far more than half his effect, by reciting poems of the
author who was the nominal subject of his lecture. The
performance would have been more appropriately styled,
“Recitations from the poems of ——.” The few
running comments introduced did not entitle it to be
classed as an original production, because they were
obviously not its governing motive.</p>

<p class='c000'>How shall the advantages of extemporizing be secured,
while avoiding its dangers? No commendation can be
given to those who simply <em>talk</em> to an audience, giving
forth only what may happen to be in mind at the moment
of delivery. The most pedantic writing and lifeless
reading would, as a habit, be preferable to such recklessness.
Unwritten speech does not preclude the fullest
preparation. The plans advocated in this volume will
enable a speaker to gather materials as widely, arrange
them as systematically, and hold them as firmly in hand,
as if every word was written; while at the same time he
may have all the freedom and play of thought, the rush
of passion, and the energy of delivery that comes in the
happiest moment of out-gushing words. But those who
are unwilling to labor may as well lay down the book.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>We do not profess to teach a process of labor-saving,
though much labor will be changed from mechanical to
intellectual, and after long experience the total saving
may be great. But in the first stages those who have
been accustomed to write in full will find that the
change involves an increase, rather than a diminution,
of work.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>An Embryo Speech, with Models of Very Simple Plans.</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The first extemporaneous speeches attempted should be
of the simplest character. Too high an ideal formed at
the outset may be very harmful by causing needless
discouragement. To speak freely in any manner, however
rude, until confidence and the power of making
every faculty available are acquired, should be the first
great object. Many persons are slaves of bad habits
through life because they began wrong. Nothing harms
an orator more than cultivating his critical taste far
beyond his power of ready utterance. There is no
necessary relation between the development of the two
things. To become a fine word-critic and master of an
excellent written style does not imply the power to strike
off finely finished sentences at the speed of the tongue;
but it does tend to render the speaker dissatisfied with
anything below the level of his written performances,
and thus checks his fluency. To master the difficult art
of written composition first, and strive afterward to gain
a similar proficiency in spoken words, is a complete
reversal of the natural method, and in all but a few
gifted minds puts a premium on failure. An unlettered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>rustic may speak with perfect ease, because he is not
conscious of the numberless verbal blunders he falls into;
but if it were possible, by some process of spiritual infusion,
to put him in possession of a fine, critical taste, he
would be instantly smitten dumb.</p>

<p class='c000'>The true method is to cultivate the faculty of extemporization
side by side with critical judgment. In case
that is done, ease and confidence will not be for a
moment disturbed. It thus appears that while an extempore
speaker can never know too much, it is quite
possible for his knowledge and cultivation to advance in
the wrong order. The pen will be of perpetual use to
the speaker; but his command of it must not increase
so rapidly in proportion as to make him ashamed of his
tongue.</p>

<p class='c000'>From this reasoning it follows that the best time to
lay the foundation of excellence in speech is very early in
life. Speeches made then are necessarily flimsy and rudimentary,
but they are not the less valuable on that
account. They are to be estimated not for their own
worth, but for their results upon the mind producing
them. The schoolboy’s first “composition” has always
been a mark for cheap witticism; but the boy himself
regards it with justifiable pride, as the first step in the
noble work of putting thought on paper. The same
pains and patience applied to the art of public talking
as to written composition will produce equal fruit.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>A few directions intended to aid in overcoming some
of the initial difficulties of speech, which may serve
as suggestions to teachers as well as helps to solitary
students, are here appended. They are purposely made
of almost ludicrous crudeness, but will not, it is trusted,
be less serviceable on that account; for it is not so
important to aid the mature speaker in giving the last
fine strokes of genius to a masterly oration, as it is to
stimulate and guide beginners in their first stammering
utterances.</p>

<p class='c000'>The simplest oration or formal address that can be
constructed has three distinct parts. With these we
will begin the great work of division and arrangement.
They may be named as follows:</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>1.</dt>
    <dd><span class='sc'>The Introduction.</span>
    </dd>
    <dt>2.</dt>
    <dd><span class='sc'>The Discussion.</span>
    </dd>
    <dt>3.</dt>
    <dd><span class='sc'>The Conclusion.</span>
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c000'>On this framework a speech-plan can be constructed
simple enough for any child. And it is at the same
time true that even a child, with such a plan, might
speak appropriately who would otherwise not be able to
begin at all.</p>

<p class='c000'>We will consider these three parts in their order.</p>

<p class='c000'>The introduction is at once important and embarrassing.
First words are nearly always heard attentively,
and they do much to determine the degree of attention
that will be bestowed on the remainder of the speech.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>The young speaker should select something as an introduction
upon which his mind can fasten, instead of
dwelling upon the frightful generality of the naked
theme. Neither is it hard to construct a good introduction
if a few plain directions are heeded, which will be
more fully given in a succeeding chapter. All persons
feel the need of some kind of a formal opening, and
therefore often begin with an apology—the very worst
form of an introduction, because it is not interesting in
itself and does not lead up to the subject.</p>

<p class='c000'>In rudimentary speech, which we are now considering,
the introduction should be simple, and, above everything
else, easy for the speaker to comprehend and remember.
If there is anything in the whole world which he is sure
he can talk about for a few moments, and which can be
made to have a moderate degree of connection with his
subject, let that be chosen for an opening. If it is also
vivid and striking in itself, and familiar to the audience,
so much the better; but this quality should not be insisted
upon in these first attempts.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the introductory topic is selected it should be
turned over in the mind until the speaker knows just
what he is going to say about it. This process will have
a wonderfully quieting effect upon his nerves. He has
fairly mastered something, and knows that at all events
he can begin his speech. It is well to make a note of
this introduction in a few simple words which will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>strongly fasten themselves in the memory. No effort
toward elaboration should be made, for that would
naturally lead to a memorized introduction, and either
require the whole speech to be written, or produce a
painful and difficult transition.</p>

<p class='c000'>The discussion deals directly with the subject or
central idea of the discourse. Here a clear statement of
at least one thought which the speaker can fully grasp
should be made. The pen (or pencil) may be used in
preparation without impropriety. If but one idea is
thought of, let that be written in the fewest and strongest
words at the student’s command. While doing this it is
likely that another and related thought will spring into
mind which can be treated in the same manner. With
diligent students there may even be a danger of getting
down too many seed-thoughts. But that contingency is
provided for in the chapters on the fully developed plan,
and needs no further notice at this time.</p>

<p class='c000'>When this central division is completely wrought out,
two other points claim attention. How shall the transition
be made from the introduction to the discussion?
A little reflection will show how to glide from one to the
other, and that process should be conned over, without
writing, until it is well understood. It is wonderful
how many outlines of ideas the memory will retain
without feeling burdened; and this power of retention
grows enormously through exercise.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>After this, the mode of gliding from the discussion to
the conclusion may be treated in the same manner, and
with equal profit. The conclusion itself is scarcely less
material than the introduction; but there is much less
range of choice in the manner of closing than in that of
beginning. The subject is before the audience, and any
wide departure from it seems like the beginning of a new
speech—something not usually well received. There is
this distinction between the relative value of introduction
and conclusion: a good introduction adds most to a
speaker’s ease, confidence, and power during the moment
of speech; but a good conclusion leaves the deepest permanent
impression upon the audience. It is usually
remembered longer than any other part of the address.</p>

<p class='c000'>When a discourse has been prepared in this simple
manner it has virtually five parts—three written and
two held in memory. From such an outline it is far
more easy to make an address than from the bare announcement
of a theme. It is true that all these parts
may be formed and held in mind without ever making
a pen-stroke. A practiced orator will do this, in a
moment, when unexpectedly called upon; or he may only
forecast the introduction and trust to finding the plan as
fast as it is needed. But in this he is no model for imitation
by beginners. Even powerful orators sometimes
spoil the whole effect of a good address by an unfortunate
mode of closing. They may forget to close in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>time—a grievous fault!—or may finish with some weak
thought or extravagant proposition, by which the whole
speech is mainly judged and all its good points neutralized.
The construction of even as simple a plan as
here indicated would have more than double the effect
of many speeches made by great men.</p>

<p class='c000'>A few simple and rude plans are annexed. No merit
is sought for in any one of them beyond making plain
the method recommended.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>PLANS OF SPEECHES.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div>EXAMPLE FIRST.</div>
    <div class='c002'><span class='sc'>Subject.—Chinese Emigration to America.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Introduction.</span>—The number of emigrants to
our country and the nations they represent.</p>

<p class='c000'>[A totally different and more effective introduction
might be the description of a group of Chinese as seen
by the speaker.]</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Discussion.</span>—The nature, amount, and present
effect of Chinese emigration.</p>

<p class='c000'>[It is possible for the speaker in his introduction to
foreshadow the position he expects to maintain in his
speech; or he may make a colorless introduction and
reserve his opinion for the discussion. The material
under this head is unlimited. It is only necessary from
the oratorical standpoint that the speaker should determine
what course to take, and then carefully think out
in advance or read—for history and statistics cannot be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>improvised—all about that which he intends to use.
When he can tell it all over easily to himself he may
reasonably feel assured of his ability to tell it to others.
The various arguments should be weighed and the best
selected. That which most naturally connects with the
introduction should be firmly fixed in the mind as the
first, that it may form the bridge from the one part to
the other.]</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Conclusion.</span>—Results of policy advocated, either
predicted, described, or shown to be probable.
Mode of remedying evils that might be apprehended
from that policy.</p>

<p class='c000'>[In the conclusion the speaker may take upon himself
the character of a prophet, poet, or logician. He may
predict results and let the statement make its own
impression. He may put all emphasis upon a vivid
painting of the future colored by the views he advocates;
or he may sum up his reasons, deduce consequences, and
weigh alternatives. The choice between these different
modes may be made instinctively, or it may require considerable
mental effort, but when made, the best mode of
transition will be very easily found.]</p>

<p class='c000'>In all this process, which in the case of undisciplined
speakers may extend over many days of hard work, the
pen may be used freely, making copious notes of facts
and arguments. After enough has been accumulated
and put in such shape that the speaker can easily look
over the entire field, he is ready for another process—that
of simplifying his plan. Rough and copious notes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>brought with him to the platform would only be a source
of embarrassment. But the germ of his ideas, which
are now familiar, can be put into very small compass.
Perhaps the following would recall everything in the
preceding outline:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Chinese Question.</span></div>
  </div>

    <dt>3.</dt>
    <dd><span class='sc'>Results.</span>
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c000'>But it is clear that a skeleton containing only three
words need not be kept in view. The whole outline of
the speech will therefore be in the mind. If numerous
figures or citations from authorities are employed, they
may be classified and read from books or notes, as needed.
Such reading in no way detracts from the extemporaneous
character of the address, though if too numerous
they tend to damp oratorical fire and break the unity of
discourse. One who has had no personal experience, or
who has not carefully observed the methods of other
speakers, can scarcely imagine how much a simple outline,
such as here suggested, accomplishes in removing
the confusion, fear, and hesitation which characterize
beginners.</p>

    <div><span class='sc'>Dean Swift’s Sermon.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>This eccentric clergyman once preached a sermon shorter
than its own text, yet having all the three parts of
which we have spoken. The text was Prov. xix, 20:
“He that pitieth the poor lendeth to the Lord; and
that which he hath given will He pay him again.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The sermon was:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Brethren, you hear the condition; if you like the
security, down with the dust.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>The collection is said to have been munificent.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this short sermon the text with the word “Brethren”
constitutes the introduction; the phrase, “you hear
the condition,” is a good transition to the discussion
contained in the next member, “if you like the security,”
which assumes the truth of the text, makes its general
declarations present and personal, and prepares the way
for the forcible and practical, if not very elegant, conclusion,
“down with the dust.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the many speeches found in Shakespeare, the
existence of these three essential parts may easily be
noted. The funeral speeches over the dead body of Julius
Cæsar afford an excellent example. The merit of the
orations of Brutus and Antony are very unequal, but
both are instructive. We will analyze them in turn.</p>

<p class='c000'>Brutus speaks first. He shows his want of appreciation
of the true nature of persuasive eloquence by
declaring that this will be an advantage. His introduction
is also too long and elaborate for the work he has in
hand. The central thought with which he opens is in
substance, “I am worthy of your closest attention.”
This cannot be considered a fortunate beginning, and it
would have been fatal for any one less highly esteemed
by the people than “the well-beloved Brutus.” He
says:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Brutus’ Speech.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>“Romans, countrymen, and lovers! hear me for my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>cause, and be silent that you may hear; believe me for
mine honor, and have respect to mine honor that you
may believe; censure me in your wisdom and awake
your senses that you may the better judge.”</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c000'>This introduction is a master-piece of Shakespeare’s
art, because it pictures so well the character of Brutus
in his dignity and blind self-confidence; but for Brutus
it is unfortunate, because it puts him on the defensive
and makes the people his judges. He must now plead
well, or they will condemn him.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the discussion the thought simply is, “I was
Cæsar’s friend, and therefore you may well believe that
I would not have killed him if he had not deserved
death because of his ambition.” This is the whole
argument, and it is weak because it does not prove the
ambition of Cæsar, or show that ambition on Cæsar’s
part was a crime which Brutus had a right to punish
with death. The antithetic sentences lack both logic and
passion. As they touch neither head nor heart, they
can have but slight and momentary effect. Notice the
discussion as an example of fine words which do not
serve their purpose.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c000'>“If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of
Cæsar’s, to him I say that Brutus’ love to Cæsar was
no less than his. If, then, that friend demand why
Brutus rose against Cæsar, this is my answer: Not that
I loved Cæsar less, but that I loved Rome more. Had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>you rather Cæsar were living, and die all slaves, than
that Cæsar were dead, to live all freemen? As Cæsar
loved me, I weep for him; as he was fortunate, I rejoice
at it; as he was valiant, I honor him; but as he was
ambitious, I slew him. There are tears for his love, joy
for his fortune, honor for his valor, and death for his
ambition. Who is here so base that would be a bondman?
If any, speak; for him have I offended. Who
is here so rude, that would not be a Roman? If any,
speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so vile
that will not love his country? If any, speak; for
him have I offended. I pause for a reply.”</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c000'>As several citizens cry out, “None, Brutus, none,” he
passes to the conclusion, which is as weak as the discussion.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c000'>“Then none have I offended. I have done no more
to Cæsar, than you shall do to Brutus. As I slew my
best lover for the good of Rome, I have the same dagger
for myself, when it shall please my country to need my
death.”</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c000'>He has gained nothing by the whole speech, save the
knowledge that none of the citizens present care at that
time to impeach him for his crime; but their minds
were open to other influences. Shakespeare thus shows
how an able man might use all his powers in the perfection
of oratorical and rhetorical forms, without producing
a great or effective speech. Antony now comes
forward. Behold the contrast!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span><span class='sc'>Antony’s Speech.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The introduction is like and unlike that of Brutus.
The same three titles are used; the same call for attention.
But there is no repetition, no egotism, no elaboration.
The introduction is short, calling attention to his ostensible
purpose, and prepares for a beautiful transition to
the discussion.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>

      <div class='line'>I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>There is not a superfluous word. But how can
Antony glide into those praises of Cæsar, which he
has disclaimed, but which are necessary to his purpose?
The next sentence solves the question:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The evil that men do lives after them;</div>
      <div class='line'>The good is oft interred with their bones;</div>
      <div class='line'>So let it be with Cæsar.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>This leads most naturally to the thought of the discussion,
which is, “No event of Cæsar’s life shows guilty
ambition; but many do reveal love to the people and
care for the general welfare. He should, therefore, be
mourned, and—the next word is not supplied by the
orator, but forced from the hearts of the people—<em>avenged!</em>”
We quote a few only of the well-known
words:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span><span class='sc'>The Discussion.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>“The noble Brutus</div>
      <div class='line'>Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious;</div>
      <div class='line'>If it were so, it were a grievous fault,</div>
      <div class='line'>And grievously hath Cæsar answered it.</div>
      <div class='line'>Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest,</div>
      <div class='line'>(For Brutus is an honorable man,</div>
      <div class='line'>So are they all, all honorable men,)</div>
      <div class='line'>Come I to speak in Cæsar’s funeral.</div>
      <div class='line'>He was my friend, faithful and just to me;</div>
      <div class='line'>But Brutus says he was ambitious,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Brutus is an honorable man.</div>
      <div class='line'>He hath brought many captives home to Rome,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose ransom did the general coffers fill.</div>
      <div class='line'>Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious?</div>
      <div class='line'>When that the poor hath cried Cæsar hath wept.</div>
      <div class='line'>Ambition should be made of sterner stuff.</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Brutus is an honorable man.</div>
      <div class='line'>You all did see, that, on the Lupercal,</div>
      <div class='line'>I thrice presented him a kingly crown,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The strongest argument against belief in guilty
ambition on the part of Cæsar and in favor of punishing
his murderers is reserved by the subtle Antony for the
last, and then he manages to have the people demand it of
him. He proceeds very naturally and effectively from
the rent robe and the bleeding body to the will of Cæsar.
This instrument gave the Romans each a large donation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>in money, and bestowed upon them collectively “his
walks, his private arbors, and new-planted orchards” as
a public park. The argument was irresistible, and
needed no elaboration. If his death was avenged as a
murder, the will would be valid; otherwise, it would be
set aside, and his estate confiscated by the conspirators.
The people, thus fired by the strongest motives of gratitude
and interest themselves supply the conclusion, and
Brutus had to fly for his life.</p>

<p class='c000'>The whole speech is worth study as an exhibition of
almost perfect eloquence. Shakespeare meant to draw
in Brutus the picture of a scholar coming before the
people with fine words, and producing little more than a
literary effect. In Antony he pictures the true orator
in the plentitude of his power, to whom words are but
servants in accomplishing his purpose of persuading and
inflaming the people. The one speech reads as if it
might have been written out in the closet and memorized;
the other gushes from the heart of the speaker as he
watches the sea of upturned faces, adapting his words
with exquisite skill to suit and swell the passions written
there.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>Initial Fear and how to Overcome it.</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>However numerous and varied may be the classes of
those who contemplate extempore speech, they are all
confronted by one common difficulty. Whether a boy
makes his maiden effort, or a man of wide thought and
ripe culture attempts for the first time to dispense with
the manuscript in which he has trusted through years of
successful public speech, the fear of failing looms up
before each of them in a manner equally formidable.</p>

<p class='c000'>The writer well remembers his first boyish venture
into this arena of peril. A debate in a village shoemaker’s
shop furnished the occasion. Two or three
“speakers” were ranged on a side, and the question was
that time-honored controversy of country lyceums—the
comparative magnitude of the wrongs suffered by the
Indians and the Negroes at the hands of the American
Government. Which side the writer was on, or what
arguments were used, has long since been forgotten, but
the palpitating heart, the terrible suspense, as one after
another of the preceding speakers made his remarks and
brought the terrible moment of facing the audience
nearer, can never cease to be remembered. When at last
called out by the voice of the presiding officer, I found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>my way to the end of a rude bench or counter that ran
partly across the room, leaned upon it, <em>shut my eyes</em>, and
began to talk. How hoarse and hollow the sound that
followed! All that was uttered was instantly forgotten
by the speaker, for one terrible thought dominated every
other—a speech was being made! My head whirled,
every nerve tingled, and a confused, roaring sound filled
my ears, while I most heartily repented of allowing
myself to be persuaded into such a frightful position.
A great dread stared at me from the end of each sentence—that
of finding nothing more to say and being
obliged to sit down amid the ridicule of neighbors and
school-fellows. When at length the agony was over,
and opening my eyes, I dropped into a seat, a striking
revulsion of feeling occurred. This rose to the height
of joy and triumph when I learned that “the speech”
had actually been ten minutes long. It was a grand
achievement!</p>

<p class='c000'>In all sober earnest, I estimate that this first effort was
probably the most profitable of my life, because it was
a beginning in the right direction. Weeks of preparation
preceded the momentous effort, and in some kind
of a way the result had been poured upon the audience.
From that time the writer was numbered among the
village debaters and shared in the advantages of the
village Lyceum—a capital means of improvement. Had
the first extemporaneous effort been made later in life,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>the shrinking and terror, would probably have been even
greater.</p>

<p class='c000'>While no way has been discovered of altogether preventing
the initial fear that attends extemporaneous
speech by the unpracticed orator, yet it may be greatly
lessened and more rapid and perfect control of it obtained
by heeding a few simple suggestions. Some serviceable
expedients have already been pointed out, and will here
only be referred to. As simple a plan as that described
in the last chapter, with lengthened meditation on each
part, will give the mind of the speaker something to do
aside from dwelling upon his own danger. He should
also prepare far more matter than can possibly be used—so
much that in the simplest and baldest statement it
will fill a respectable period of time. He need not be
careful as to how he speaks, or in how many forms he
repeats the same idea. Originality, also, may safely be
neglected. The object is not to talk especially well, or
to utter that which has never been uttered before, but
only to keep on talking until self-possession and the
mastery of every faculty have been fully restored. This
preparation of great quantities of material with no care
as to the graces of delivery may expose the speaker in
time to another peril—that of being tedious and wearisome;
but this is not the source of the initial fear with
which we are now dealing, and when it becomes a real
evil there are effectual means of guarding against it.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>A further direction is that the mode of introduction
be very firmly fixed in the mind. This wonderfully
calms the speaker. He knows that he can begin even if
he never gets any further; and by the time the introduction
is passed, if the man possesses any natural aptitude
for speech, his mind will in all ordinary cases have
recovered its equilibrium, and be ready to devise and
direct everything that follows.</p>

<p class='c000'>The plan and the full notes which have been made
should also be kept within easy reach, or even in the
hand—not with the intention of using them, for that is
the very thing to be avoided, but that the speaker, by
knowing that they can be referred to in an emergency,
may be guarded against “stage fright.” He may also
exercise self-control by not looking at them unless absolutely
driven to it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The object of first efforts—even for the orator who is
great in other modes of delivery—is not to make a great
or admired speech, but only to get through the ordeal
without disgrace or failure. Quality must be sought
later. To get any reasonable quantity of speech at first,
to satisfy yourself that you can both think and talk
when on your feet, is achievement enough.</p>

<p class='c000'>One caution may be offered to the man possessing a
good written style which the boy will not need. Do
not make your preparation so minutely or verbally that
the very words linger in your memory. If you do, one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>of two things will probably happen: either you will
recite a memorized speech, which, however fine in itself,
will contribute nothing to the object of learning to speak
extemporaneously, or the fine fragments of remembered
diction that flood in your mind will be so out of harmony
with the words spontaneously evolved as to produce a
continual series of jars and discords noticeable to every
one, and to none more painfully than to yourself. The
writer once listened to a speech of this mixed character,
in which the orator would soar for a time on the wings
of most excellent words, and then drop down to his ordinary
and very meagre vocabulary. So frequent and
unexpected were these transitions that the orator’s progress
suggested nothing so much as traveling over one
of those western corduroy roads, where the wheels of the
carriage first rise with a great effort on top of a log, and
then plunge into fathomless depths of mud! Rather
than such jolting, it is better that the experimental
speeches should never rise above the level of mere talk,
and thus maintain a uniform progress. In due time all
qualified persons can lift their extemporaneous words as
high as the utmost reach of the pen. But first must be
gained the power of standing unprotected by a paper wall,
face to face with an audience and employing every faculty
as calmly and efficiently as in the study. Practice in
talking to the people will make this possible and easy,
but nothing else will.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER V.<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>Utility of Debating Societies.</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Comparatively little attention is paid to the direct
cultivation of extemporaneous oratory in schools and
colleges. Indirectly, much help is given by teaching
many things which go to furnish the orator with ideas
and words, but the combination of these into that noble
effort of human genius—a speech—is left to individual
research or to accident. A few schools of oratory have
been founded which give a large and probably disproportionate
share of attention to elocution in the form of
stage or dramatic reading; but even the best of these are
as yet but entering upon their real work of cultivating
thoroughly the power of persuasive public speech. When
each college shall have a chair of extempore speech,
and each academy shall give as much attention to unpremeditated
utterances in conversation and public address
as is now bestowed upon Greek or Latin, the oratory of
pulpit, bar, platform, and legislature will be of a vastly
higher type.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some newspaper critics have deprecated teaching the
art of speech on the ground that there is already too
much public talking. This view, if seriously entertained,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>is very narrow and misleading. Not more, but better
speech—an increase of quality, rather than quantity—would
result from cultivation, and improved methods.
And it may also be argued that if a great part of the
work of life is found in convincing, instructing, and persuading
our fellows, an abundance of speech is absolutely
required. As freedom and mental activity increase, the
only practicable modes of leading and governing men,
which rest upon persuasive speech, will be more urgently
demanded. In a state where the will of one man is law,
political speech has little place; and in a Church where
independent thought is heresy and the mass of the people
accept unquestioningly the precise form of faith in which
they were born, preaching will have a very narrow field.
But in our own country it is our boast that we determine
every subject by free discussion; and it is clear that a
man who can take no part in the oral battles that are
continually waged about him is placed at a great disadvantage.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the literary societies generally connected with
schools do afford very valuable help in acquiring the art
of oratory. Not only their formal exercises, but their
discussion of points of order and procedure, and the
management of the business and government of such
societies, call out talking talent. Debating societies or
lyceums give the same kind of facilities to speakers
outside of educational halls. A spirited debate on some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>topic not above the comprehension of the debaters
affords one of the best possible means of acquiring the
prime faculties of assurance and fluency. In such
debates the question is chosen, the sides assigned, and
ample time given for that kind of preparation which
can only be effectually made in the general study of the
subject. There is no great temptation to write a speech
for a coming debate, as its formal sentences would fit
poorly into the line of argument, the course of which
cannot be foreseen, even if their substance should not be
anticipated by a speaker on the same side. But the
more general knowledge of the subject in its entire range
that can be acquired the better, so long as it does not
overwhelm the speaker. The opening speech may
indeed be planned in advance with some definiteness,
but all others will be colored and modified by the situation
into which the debate has been drawn. Each participant
is under a strong stimulus to do his best, sure,
if successful, of warm approval by his colleagues and
sweet triumph over his opponents. After the opening
speech each contestant will have the time his predecessor
is speaking for arranging arguments and preparing an
answer. The stimulus of contradiction rouses every
faculty to the highest energy. Each argument is scrutinized
for the purpose of discovering its weak point,
and nothing will pass on trust. It may as well be
acknowledged that the gladiatorial spirit, though in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>modified form, is still rife in the civilized world. The
“joy of conflict” may be tasted as well in the sharp
encounters of an earnest debate upon some topic of
absorbing interest as on the battle-field. A society which
furnishes its members continual opportunity for speech,
under such conditions cannot fail to be a powerful
educator in the direction of extemporaneous speech. In
such encounters, the freedom that belongs to this kind of
address is most highly appreciated, and the mistaken
considerations of dignity and propriety which so often
take all life and heart from speech can have little
weight. Debates have indeed been occasionally carried
on by means of essays in place of speeches, but such
encounters have been tame and listless affairs, and have
soon given place to the real article. Among the American
statesmen who have taken their first lessons in the art
which paved their way to greatness in country debating
societies may be reckoned Henry Clay, Abraham Lincoln,
James A. Garfield, and many others only less eminent.</p>

<p class='c000'>Enough inducements, we trust, have been set forth to
lead every student of speech to find or make an opportunity
for availing himself of this capital means of cultivation.
Let him enter upon the work of debating,
earnestly resolving (after the first few efforts) to do the
very best in his power. Let him arrange his material
carefully, select a striking mode of opening each address,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>and strive to close in such a manner as to leave the best
effect on the minds of his hearers. As he debates for
improvement rather than for immediate victory, he will,
of course, despise all tricks and seek to win fairly, or—what
is just as important a lesson—he will learn to
accept defeat gracefully.</p>

<p class='c000'>The skeletons of two speeches on opposite sides of the
same question are here presented for the purpose of
showing how a simple plan will hold to the proper place
all the thoughts and arguments that may be accumulated.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>Two kinds of preparation contribute to the production
of eloquence. One is the preparation of the speaker,
the other of the speech. The first is fully as important
as the second. In ordinary cases both are indispensable.
Some “born orators” speak well without appearing to
pay any attention to the improvement of their faculties.
Others are occasionally eloquent on a topic without
special preparation. Yet these cases when closely examined
will be found apparent rather than real exceptions
to the rule above stated. The man who seems
never to have cultivated the power of speech, and is yet
able to blaze into fervid eloquence at will, has usually
concealed his preparation or carried it on in such uncommon
methods that they have not been recognized as
preparations. On the other hand, a man who speaks
well without a moment’s warning can do so only when
the subject is thoroughly familiar to him. A ready and
self-possessed speaker may grasp thoughts which have
been long maturing in his mind, and give them forth to
an audience in obedience to an unexpected summons, but
if he is called upon when he knows nothing whatever of
his subject, failure is inevitable, though he may possibly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>veil it more or less in a stream of platitudes. Ask a
man at a moment’s warning to give an astronomical
lecture. If he is perfectly familiar with the subject in
general, and is also a practical orator, he may succeed
well without preparing a special speech. But if he is
ignorant of Astronomy, what kind of an address can he
make? If he is the most eloquent man in the nation
that faculty will avail him nothing, for he cannot extemporize
the names of the planets, the laws which govern
their motions, or any of the facts out of which his lecture
must be woven. Precisely the same necessity of adequate
information exists in every other field of intelligence.
The ignorant man cannot possibly tell that which he does
not know, although he may make a great show of knowledge
out of small material; but even to do that with
certainty requires careful premeditation and arrangement.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this and following chapters we wish to treat of
the kind of cultivation which makes a man ready to
speak. The field is here very wide and some general
considerations must be introduced, but we hope also to
give valuable practical directions, especially to those
who are yet at the beginning of their career.</p>

<p class='c000'>In considering man as a speaker, we may classify his
faculties into two broad divisions; those which furnish
the <em>materials</em> of communication with his fellows; and
those which furnish the <em>means</em> of such communication.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>The first class gives rise to thoughts and emotions in
man’s own breast; the second enables him to arouse
similar thoughts and emotions in the breasts of others.
Our course, therefore, will be to consider, first, thought
and emotion, and afterward those powers of body and
mind by which we express, that is, <em>press out</em> from ourselves
toward the receptive faculties of our fellow beings.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Thought</em>, in the broad sense here given, embraces
the knowledge of all facts, and all the reasoning that may
be based upon those facts. <em>Emotion</em> is the mental feeling
or response to knowledge, and comprises love, hate, joy,
fear, sorrow, and hope. These two elements are the
broad basis of all eloquence. Keen, profound, far-reaching
thought—in other words, thought raised to its
highest terms—and quick, sensitive, powerful emotion,
are necessary to the highest eloquence. Compared with
them, mere verbal fluency is less than dust in the
balance. But such a combination—the highest degree
of both thought and emotion—is rare, and many degrees
less than the highest of either is available for genuine
eloquence. To increase either or both, if it can be
done without any corresponding sacrifice, is to increase
eloquence in precisely the same proportion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Education in the popular sense is the cultivation of
thought with the added faculty of language. But we
prefer to consider the latter power separately as one
among the means of communicating thought.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>How, then, shall thought-power be increased? There
is no royal road. Every one of the faculties by which
knowledge is accumulated and arranged or digested into
new forms grows stronger by being employed upon its
own appropriate objects. Exercise is then the means by
which the material of knowledge is gathered, and all
faculties strengthened for future gathering. Each fact
gained adds to the treasury of thought. A broad and
liberal education is of exceeding advantage. This may
or may not be of the schools. Indeed, they too often
substitute a knowledge of words for a knowledge of
things. That fault is very serious to the orator, for the
only way by which even language can be effectively
taught, is by giving terms to objects, the nature of
which has been previously learned.</p>

<p class='c000'>But many persons need to speak who cannot obtain an
education in the usual sense of the words—that is,
college or seminary training. Must they keep their lips
forever closed on that account? By no means.</p>

<p class='c000'>A thousand examples, some of them the most eminent
speakers the world has produced, encourage them to
hope. Let such persons learn all they can. Wide,
well-selected, and systematic reading will do wonders in
supplying the necessary thought-material. Every book
of history, biography, travels, popular science, which is
carefully read, and its contents fixed in the mind, will
be available for the purposes of oratory. Here a word
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>of advice may be offered, which, if heeded, will be worth
many months of technical education at the best colleges
in the land; it is this: have always at hand some work
that in its own sphere possesses real and permanent
merit, and read it daily until completed. If notes are
made of its contents, and the book itself kept on hand
for reference, so much the better. If some friend can be
found who will hear you relate in your own words what
you have read, this also will be of great value. Many
persons, especially in our own country, spend time enough
in reading the minute details of the daily papers to make
them thoroughly acquainted in ten years with forty volumes
of the most useful books in the world. Think of
it! This number may include nearly all the literary
masterpieces. Which mode of spending the time will
produce the best results? One newspaper read daily
would amount to more than three hundred in a year, and
allowing each paper to be equal to ten ordinary book
pages, the result would be three thousand pages annually,
or six volumes of five hundred pages each. In ten years
this would reach <em>sixty</em> volumes! This number, comprising
the world’s best books in history, poetry, science,
and general literature, might be read slowly, with meditation
and diligent note-taking, by the most busy man
who was willing to employ his leisure in that way.
Libraries and books are now brought within the reach
of all, and the mass of what man knows can be learned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>in outline by any student who thirsts for knowledge.
While thus engaged the student is on the direct road
toward oratorical efficiency, though such knowledge will
not in itself constitute eloquence. It is but one of its
elements. Neither will the speaker have to wait until
any definite quantity of reading has been accomplished
before it becomes serviceable to him. All that he learns
will be immediately available, and, with proper effort,
the facility of speech and the material for speaking will
keep pace with each other.</p>

<p class='c000'>But personal observation of life and nature are just
as necessary as reading. The world of books is very
extensive, but it yields its treasures only to persons who
bring to its study some independent knowledge of their
own. We cannot hope to add much to the world’s stock
of knowledge by what we see with our own eyes, but
what we do see and hear will interpret for us what we
learn from the far wider world of books. Gibbon tells
us that his militia service, though of no great advantage
in itself, was afterward very useful to the historian
of the Roman Empire. What we behold of the landscape
around us lays the foundation for understanding
what poets and travelers tell us of other landscapes we
may never see. Book knowledge will become real and
vivid just in proportion as it is brought into comparison
with the observation of our own senses. To the orator,
this is far more important than to the ordinary student,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>for it adds greatly to the royal faculty of imagination. A
description from the lips of a speaker who beholds at the
moment a mental picture, accurate as a photograph, and
bright with color, will be very different from another
description built up only of words, however well chosen
and melodious the latter may be. A little dabbling in
natural science, a few experiments tried, an occasional
peep through telescope or microscope at the worlds they
open, and all other means of bringing knowledge under
the scrutiny of our own senses, will greatly contribute to
the power of the orator.</p>

<p class='c000'>The reasoning faculties must also be trained by exercise
upon their own objects. The knowledge which has
been gathered from personal observation or from the
testimony of others in books will furnish material, but
will not enable us to reason. Logic and mathematics
have considerable utility as guides, but they cannot supply
the want of continuous application of the processes of
argument and deduction. No man becomes a reasoner
from merely learning the mode in which the reason
operates. Of two persons, one of whom understands
every mood of the syllogism and the source of every
fallacy, while the other has no technical knowledge of
logic, but has been engaged in careful reasoning, discussion,
and argument, all his life, it may easily happen that
the latter will be the better reasoner of the two—just as
a man might learn from the books all the rules of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>game of croquet, and yet be beaten by another who
continually handled the mallet, but had never read a
single rule. Practice makes perfect. Essay writing,
constructing arguments, tracing effects back to their
causes, making careful comparison of all things that can
be compared, in short, bringing our judgment to bear
upon all facts, forming our own opinions of every event,
and being always ready to give a reason to those who
ask,—these modes of exercise will make the faculty of
reason grow continually stronger. It is not pretended
that these or any other modes of cultivation can make
all minds equal, but they will improve any one—the
lowest as surely as the most active—though the interval
after both have been thus exercised will remain as great
as before.</p>

<p class='c000'>Extempore speech itself, when practiced upon carefully
arranged plans or models as recommended hereafter, is
one of the most powerful modes of cultivating the logical
faculty. To construct plans, so that all thoughts
accumulated upon a given subject may be unfolded in a
natural and orderly manner, cannot fail to exercise the
reasoning faculties, and impart corresponding strength to
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>But how shall emotion be cultivated? The wisest
speech, if deep feeling neither throbs in the words nor
is manifested in delivery, cannot be eloquent. The
orator can only speak forth from an aroused and excited
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>nature. There is a kind of intellectual excitation
kindled by the presentation of truth which is sufficiently
effective when instruction is the only object.
But to persuade and move men—the usual aim of the
orator—requires passion. No pretense will avail the
extempore speaker. He will infallibly be detected if
counterfeiting, and to succeed in exhibiting feeling he
must really feel. There are but two things which can
arouse feeling—care for a cause or for persons. Many a
man is eloquent when “riding his hobby,” though at no
other time. He has thought so much upon that special
subject, and has so thoroughly identified himself with it,
that everything relating to it becomes invested with personal
interest. Any cause which can thus be made personal
will be apt to arouse feeling. It would be wise,
therefore, for an orator to identify himself as closely as
possible with all manner of good causes which come
within his reach. Then such well-springs of emotion
will gush out easily and frequently.</p>

<p class='c000'>This mode of excitation is largely intellectual in its
character. The next to be described has more to do with
the affections. The clergyman wants to secure the welfare
of his congregation, and the better he is acquainted
with them individually the stronger will be this wish.
The lawyer is but a poor attorney if he does not so
identify himself with his client as to feel more than a
professional interest in the latter’s success. The politician
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>needs no exhortation to rouse his enthusiasm for his
party and his chief. All these are instances of that care
for persons which adds so greatly to the powers of effective
speech. The plain inference, therefore, is that the
speaker will gain largely by identifying himself as
closely as possible with the interests of men, and by cultivating
love for them. A cynical or indifferent spirit
makes a fearful discount from the possibilities of
eloquence. Only the greatest qualities in other directions
can prevent it from proving fatal.</p>

<p class='c000'>The power and sensitiveness of emotions founded upon
intimate knowledge and partnership of interest go far
to explain the wonderful eloquence of the old Greeks.
Their country was the native land of eloquence. This
arose not so much from the character of that gifted race
as from the fact that each speaker personally knew his
audience and had an intimate, material interest in the
affairs he discussed. They regarded their opponents as
terribly bad men. Their own lives and the lives of
many of their friends were not unfrequently involved in
the questions they discussed. The States were so small,
and the personal element so important, that strongly
aroused feeling became inevitable. The discussion of
war or peace before an audience who knew that if they
voted war their town might be besieged by the enemy
within a fortnight, was sure to be eagerly listened to.
No platitudes would be tolerated. The orators spoke
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>before their neighbors, some of them friendly, others
bitter enemies who were seeking in each word they
uttered an occasion for their ruin. Much of the wonderful
power of Demosthenes arose from the deep solicitude
felt by himself and excited in his hearers as they
watched the swiftly coming ruin of their common
country.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is also a law of human nature that we feel deeply
for that which has cost us great labor. The collector of
old china or of entomological specimens learns to
greatly value the ugly dishes and bugs he gathers, though
others may despise them. The more of real work we
do in the world, the deeper the hold our hearts take
upon it. This is one of the secrets of the power of
goodness as an element of oratory. It was long ago
declared that a good man, other things being equal, will
be a better speaker than a bad man. His affections are
called forth by a greater variety of objects. Yet hate
can make a man eloquent as well as love, and some of
the most eloquent orations ever uttered partook largely
of this baleful inspiration. But the occasions on which
noble feelings may rise into eloquence are far more
numerous and important.</p>

<p class='c000'>Why should not a man train himself to take a deep
interest in all that is brought familiarly to his notice?
This wide range of sympathy is one of the marks which
distinguishes a great from a small mind. It has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>said that “lunar politics” can have no possible interests
for the inhabitants of this globe. But who can be sure
of this, if there be such a thing as “lunar politics”?
The wider our knowledge the more we recognize the
possibility of interests which we had not before dreamed
of. If there are inhabitants on the moon, and if we
have an immortal existence, it is far from impossible
that we might some time be brought into the closest connection
with them. No man can tell the bearing of a
new fact upon human welfare, more than he can write
the history of a new-born babe. At any rate, every
fact is a part of the great system of truth which lies all
about us, and which is adapted to the needs of our intellect.
Let it also be remembered that all men are kindred,
and that we should make common cause with them.
When this comes to be the habitual attitude of the mind,
not as a mere sentiment, but as a strong and steady
impulse, impassioned speech on any great theme affecting
the interests of nations or individual men will be easy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Emotion cannot be feigned, neither can it be directly
roused by an effort of the will. We cannot say, “Now
I will be in a furious passion,” or, “Now I will be
inflamed with wrath against this great wrong,” for the
mere sake of speaking better upon the subject in hand.
But we can gaze upon a great wrong, and meditate upon
the evil it involves, until the tides of indignant emotion
arise in our breast. Many a well-prepared speech has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>failed of effect, because the orator was so anxious about
the form of his address and his own popularity as to
lose interest in the subject itself. Sometimes speeches
read or recited fail from an opposite cause. The interest
has once been aroused, and having burned during the
protracted period of composition, it cools and cannot be
recalled. No energy, declamation, or elegance of diction
can redeem this capital defect.</p>

<p class='c000'>To tell a man in general terms how he may widen his
sympathies and enter into the closest bonds with his fellows
is difficult. It is much easier to tell him what not
to do. The hermits of the desert took exactly the
wrong course. They lost the power of eloquence except
upon some theme which could be wedded to their solitary
musings. Peter the Hermit was roused to fury by the
tales of wrongs to pilgrims in the Holy City—almost
the only thing that could have made him eloquent. But
on that one topic he spoke like a man inspired and was
able to call all Europe to arms. Whatever separates
from the common interests of humanity must diminish
the power or at least the range of genuine emotion. To
know a great many men, to understand their business
affairs, to enter into their joy and fear, to watch the feelings
that rise and fall in their hearts, is sure to deepen
our own feelings by unconscious imitation and sympathy.
Each new friend is an added power of noblest emotion—a
new point at which the world takes hold of our hearts.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>How many persons are eloquent for a cause only! On
the other hand, some men care nothing for general principles,
but will throw their whole soul into a conflict for
friends.</p>

<p class='c000'>That man is well furnished for eloquence who knows
a great deal, who can mentally combine, arrange, and
reason correctly upon what he knows, who feels a personal
interest in every fact with which his memory is
stored, and every principle which can be deduced from
those facts, and who has so great an interest in his fellows
that all deeds which affect them awaken the same
response in his heart as if done to himself. He will
then possess all the necessary treasures of thought, and
will himself be warmed by the fires of emotion. The
only remaining problem will be to find the manner of
communicating his thought and emotion in undiminished
force to others through the medium of speech.</p>

<p class='c000'>The mode of cultivating the powers necessary to this
end will next engage our attention.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VII.<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>Language.</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The preceding chapter dealt with those faculties which
provide the materials of speech, and in one sense was
scarcely appropriate to a treatise designed to show the
best modes of communicating knowledge. Yet it was
difficult to approach the subject intelligibly in any other
way. So much has been said about the natural power
of oratory that it was necessary to define its character
and to show how it might be supplemented by cultivation.
But it is more directly our task to point out the
mode of improving the communicative faculties.</p>

<p class='c000'>First in importance among these stands language.
Without its assistance thought could not be consecutively
imparted. Some vague and intangible conceptions might
arise within our own minds, but even these could not be
given to other minds without the medium of words.
The power of language is distinct from general intellectual
ability. It by no means follows that a man who
possesses important thoughts and deep emotions will be
able to communicate them well; but a very moderate
endowment of the word-faculty may be so cultivated as
to fulfill every requirement. Diligent practice in the
methods advised below will enable the great majority of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>men to express their thoughts with fullness and accuracy.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are certain laws in every language made binding
by custom, which cannot be transgressed without exposing
the offender to the severe penalty of ridicule and
contempt. These laws form the basis of grammar, and
must be thoroughly learned. If a man has been under
the influence of good models from childhood, correctness
will be a matter almost of instinct; but the reverse of
this is frequently the case. Even then there is but little
difficulty experienced by any one who will take the
necessary pains, in learning to write in accordance with
the rules of speech, and when this power has been
attained there is a standard formed by which to judge our
spoken words. But it is not enough for the extempore
speaker to be able to reduce his sentences to correctness
by recasting, pruning, or adding to them. They should
be required to present themselves at first in correct form
and in rounded completeness. He has no time to think
of right or wrong constructions, and the only safe way,
therefore, is to make the right so habitual that the wrong
will not once be thought of. In other words, we must
not only be able to express ourselves correctly by tongue
and pen, but the very current of unspoken words that
flows in our brains must be shaped in full conformity to
the laws of language. When we exercise the power of
continuous grammatical <em>thinking</em>, there will be no difficulty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>in avoiding the ridiculous blunders which are supposed
to be inseparable from extempore speech.</p>

<p class='c000'>Correctness in pronunciation is also of importance.
Usage has given each word its authorized sound, which
no person can frequently mistake without rendering himself
liable to the easiest and most damaging of all criticisms.
Bad pronunciation produces another and extremely
hurtful effect upon extempore speech. The mental
effort necessary to discriminate between two modes of
pronouncing a word, neither of which is known to be
right, diverts the mind from the subject and produces embarrassment
and hesitation. Accuracy in the use of
words, which is a charm in spoken no less than written
language, may also be impaired from the same cause; for
if two terms that may be used for the same idea are
thought of, only one of which can be pronounced with certainty,
that one will be preferred, even if the other be the
more suitable. The extemporizer ought to be so familiar
with the sound of all common words that none but the
right pronunciation and accent will ever enter his mind.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fluency</em> and <em>accuracy</em> in the use of words are two
qualities that have often been confounded, though perfectly
distinct. To the speaker they are of equal importance,
while the writer has far more need of the latter.
All words have their own peculiar shades of meaning.
They have been builded up into their present shape
through long ages. By strange turns and with many a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>curious history have they glided into the significations
they now bear; and each one is imbedded in the minds
of the people as the representative of certain definite
ideas. Words are delicate paints that, to the untutored
eye, may seem of one color, but each has its own place
in the picture painted by the hand of genius, and can be
supplanted by no other. Many methods have been suggested
for learning these fine shades of meaning. The
study of Greek and Latin has been urged as the best and
almost the only way: such study may be very useful
for discipline, and will give much elementary knowledge
of the laws of language: but the man who knows no
other tongue than his own need not consider himself
debarred from the very highest place as a master of
words. The careful study of a good etymological dictionary
will, in time, give him about all the valuable
information bearing upon this subject that he could
obtain from the study of many languages. In general
reading, let him mark every word he does not perfectly
understand, and from the dictionary find its origin, the
meaning of its roots, and its varied significations at the
present day. This will make the word as familiar as an
old acquaintance, and when he meets it again he will
notice if the author uses it correctly. The student may
not be able to examine every word in the language, but
by this mode he will be led to think of the meaning of
each one he sees; and from this silent practice he will learn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>the beauty and power of English as fully as if he sought
it through the literatures of Greece and Rome. If this
habit is long continued it will cause words to be used
correctly in thinking as well as in speaking. To read a
dictionary consecutively and carefully (ignoring the old
story about its frequent change of subject) will also be
found very profitable.</p>

<p class='c000'>Translating from any language, ancient or modern,
will have just the same tendency to teach accurate expression
as careful original composition. In either case
the improvement comes from the search for words that
exactly convey certain ideas, and it matters not what the
source of the ideas may be. The use of a good thesaurus,
or storehouse of words, may also be serviceable by showing
in one view all the words that relate to any subject.</p>

<p class='c000'>But none of these methods will greatly increase <em>fluency</em>.
There is a practical difference between merely knowing
a term and that easy use of it which only habit can give.
Elihu Burritt, with his knowledge of fifty languages,
has often been surpassed in fluency, force, and variety of
expression by an unlettered farmer, because the few
words the latter knew were always ready. There is no
way to increase this easy and fluent use of language
without much practice in utterance. Where and how
can such practice be obtained?</p>

<p class='c000'>Conversation affords an excellent means for this kind
of improvement. We do not mean the running fire of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>question and answer, glancing so rapidly back and forth
as to allow no time for premeditating or explaining anything,
but real and rational talk—an exchange of
thoughts and ideas clearly and intelligibly expressed.
The man who engages much in this kind of conversation
can scarcely fail to become an adept in the art of
expressing his thoughts in appropriate language. Talk
much; express your ideas in the best manner possible;
if difficult at first, persevere, and it will become easier.
Thus you will learn eloquence in the best and most
pleasing school. The common conversational style—that
in which man deals directly with his fellow man—is
the germ of true oratory. It may be amplified and
systematized; but talking bears to eloquence the same
relation that the soil does to the tree that springs out of
its bosom.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the best thoughts of men and the noblest expressions
are seldom found floating on the sea of common
talk. To drink the deepest inspiration, our minds must
often come in loving communion with the wise and
mighty of all ages. In the masterpieces of literature we
will find “thought knit close to thought,” and, what is
still more to our present purpose, words so applied as to
breathe and live. These passages should be read until
their spirit sinks into our hearts and their melody rings
like a blissful song in our ears. To memorize many
such passages will be a profitable employment. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>words of which such masterpieces are composed, with
the meanings they bear in their several places, will thus
be fixed in our minds ready to drop on our tongues when
needed. This conning of beautiful passages is not now
recommended for the purpose of quotation, although they
may often be used in that manner to good advantage,
but simply to print the individual words with their signification
more deeply in memory.</p>

<p class='c000'>This may be effected, also, by memorizing selections
from our own best writings. What is thus used should
be highly polished, and yet preserve, as far as possible,
the natural form of expression. Carried to a moderate
extent, this exercise tends to elevate the character of our
extemporaneous efforts by erecting a standard that is our
own, and therefore suited to our tastes and capacities;
but if made habitual, it will induce a reliance upon the
memory rather than on the power of spontaneous production,
and thus destroy the faculty it was designed to
cultivate.</p>

<p class='c000'>But no means of cultivating fluency in language can
rival extempore speech itself. The only difficulty is to
find a sufficient number of occasions to speak. Long
intervals of preparation have great advantages as far as
the gathering of material for discourse is concerned; but
they have disadvantages, also, which can only be overcome
by more diligent effort in other directions.</p>

<p class='c000'>Clear and definite ideas greatly increase the power of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>language. When a thought is fully understood it falls
into words as naturally as a summer cloud, riven by the
lightning, dissolves into rain. So easy is it to express a
series of ideas, completely mastered, that a successful
speaker once said, “It is a man’s own fault if he ever
fails. Let him prepare as he ought, and there is no
danger.” The assertion was too strong, for failure may
come from other causes than a want of preparation. Yet
the continuance of careful drill, in connection with frequent
speaking and close preparation, will give very
great ease and certainty of expression. The “blind but
eloquent” preacher, Milburn, says that he gave four years
of his life—the time spent as chaplain at Washington—to
acquire the power of speaking correctly and easily
without the previous use of the pen, and he declares that
he considers the time well spent. His style is diffuse,
sparkling, rhetorical, the most difficult to acquire, though
not by any means the most valuable. An earnest, nervous,
and yet elegant style may be formed by those who
have the necessary qualifications in much shorter time.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>Imagination.</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Nothing adds more to the brilliancy and effectiveness
of oratory than the royal faculty of imagination. This
weird and glorious power deals with truth as well as fiction
and gives to its fortunate possessor the creative, life-breathing
spirit of poetry.</p>

<p class='c000'>Listen to the description of natural scenery by a person
of imagination, and afterward by another destitute
of that faculty! Each may be perfectly accurate and
refer to the same objects, even enumerating the same
particulars in the same order; but the one gives a catalogue,
the other a picture. In relating a story or enforcing
an argument, the same difference in the vividness of
impression is apparent.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is said of Henry Ward Beecher, who possesses a
strong imagination, that the people would listen with
delighted attention if he only described the mode in
which a potato grew! He would see a thousand beauties
in its budding and blossoming, and paint the picture so
vividly as to command universal attention.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Bible, which is the most popular of all books, is
pre-eminently a book of imagination. Nowhere is loftier
or more beautiful imagery employed, or wrought into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>more exquisite forms. A few short and simple words
paint pictures that the world looks upon with astonishment
from age to age. Paradise Lost, the most sublime
imaginative poem in the language of man, drew much of
its inspiration from a few passages in Genesis. Job and
Isaiah are without rivals in the power of picturing by
means of words, sublime objects beyond the grasp of
mortal vision.</p>

<p class='c000'>While illustrations and comparisons flow principally
from the reasoning faculties, their beauty and sparkle
come from imagination. Without its influence these
may explain and simplify, but they have no power to
interest the hearer or elevate the tenor of discourse.</p>

<p class='c000'>How may imagination be cultivated? It is said that
“Poets are born, not made,” but the foundation of every
other faculty also is in nature, while all are useless,
unless improved, and applied. Imagination will increase
in vigor and activity by proper use. Its function is to
form complete mental images from the detached materials
furnished by the senses. It gathers from all
sources and mixes and mingles until a picture is produced.
The proper way to cultivate it lies in forming
abundance of just such pictures and in finishing them
with all possible care. Let the orator, on the canvas of
the mind, paint in full size and perfect coloring, every
part of his speech which relates to material or visible
things. Illustrations also can usually be represented in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>picturesque form. We do not now speak of outward
representation, but of viewing all objects in clear distinctness,
through the eye of the mind. It is not enough
for the speaker, if he would reach the highest success, to
gather all the facts he wishes to use, to arrange them in
the best order, or even to premeditate the very form of
words. Instead of the latter process, he may more profitably
strive to embrace all that can be pictured in one
mental view. If he can summon before him in the
moment of description the very scenes and events about
which he is discoursing, and behold them vividly as in a
waking dream, it is probable that his auditors will see
them in the same manner. A large part of all discourses
may thus be made pictorial. In <em>Ivanhoe</em>, one of the
characters looks out through a castle window and describes
to a wounded knight within the events of the assault which
was being made upon the castle. Any person could describe
the most stirring scene vividly and well in the moment
of witnessing it. A strong imagination enables a speaker
or poet to see those things he speaks of almost as accurately
and impressively as if passing before his bodily
eyes, and often with far more brightness of color. To
make the effort to see what we write or read will have
a powerful effect in improving the imaginative faculty.</p>

<p class='c000'>Reading and carefully pondering the works of those
who have imagination in high degree will also be helpful.
The time devoted to the enjoyment of great poems
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>is not lost to the orator. They give richness and tone
to his mind, introduce him into scenes of ideal beauty,
and furnish him with many a striking thought and glowing
image.</p>

<p class='c000'>Most of the sciences give as full scope to imagination
in its best workings as poetry itself. Astronomy and
geology are pre-eminent in this particular. Everything
about them is grand. They deal with immense
periods of time, vast magnitudes, and sublime histories.
Each science requires the formation of mental images and
thus gives the advantages we have already pointed out.
It is possible for a scientific man to deal exclusively with
the shell rather than the substance of science, with its
technical names and definitions rather than its grand
truths; but in this case the fault is with himself rather
than with his subject. The dryness of scientific and even
mathematical studies relates only to the preliminary departments.
A philosopher once said that success in science
and in poetry depended upon the same faculties. He was
very nearly right. The poet is a creator who forms new
worlds of his own. The greatest of their number thus
describes the process by which imagination performs its
magic.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The poet’s eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,</div>
      <div class='line'>Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, as imagination bodies forth</div>
      <div class='line'>The forms of things unknown, the poet’s pen</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing</div>
      <div class='line'>A local habitation and a name.</div>
      <div class='line'>Such tricks hath strong imagination.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Almost the same result must be reached in many departments
of science, with the aid of only a few scattered facts
for a basis. The geologist has some broken bones, withered
leaves, and fragments of rock, from which to reconstruct
the primitive world. From the half-dozen facts observed
through his telescope, the astronomer pictures the physical
condition of distant planets. In every science the
same need exists for imagination in its highest, most
truthful function, and the same opportunity is, therefore,
afforded for its cultivation.</p>

<p class='c000'>An eminent elocutionist frequently urged his classes to
employ all pauses in mentally picturing the idea contained
in the coming sentence. He declared that by this means
the expression of the voice was rendered more rich and
true. In uttering our own words this process is at once
more easy and more fruitful in varied advantages.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>Voice and Gesture.</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Voice and gesture form the immediate link between
the speaker and his audience. The value of good quality
in both is sometimes over-estimated, though it is always
considerable. A good voice, well managed, gives powerful
and vivid expression to thought, but cannot supply
the absence of it. Neither is such a voice indispensable.
Many instances of high success against vocal
disadvantages might be mentioned; but these only prove
that other excellencies may atone for a single defect.
We can never be indifferent to the charms of a good
voice, that modulates with every emotion and responds
to the finest shades of feeling. It has much of the
pleasing quality of music.</p>

<p class='c000'>But this harmony cannot be evoked by merely
mechanical training. To teach the pupil just what note
on the musical scale he must strike to express a particular
emotion, how much of an inflection must be used to
express joy or sorrow, and how many notes down the
scale mark a complete suspension of sense, is absurd:
speech can never be set to music.</p>

<p class='c000'>But let it not be inferred from this that voice cultivation
is useless. The more perfect the instrument for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>expression of thought can be made, the better it will be
fitted for its high office. An orator may profitably spend
a little time daily for years in training the voice, for it
is a faculty he must continually employ, and none is
more susceptible of improvement. The passion evoked
in animated speech will demand for its adequate expression
almost every note and key within the compass of
the voice; and unless it has previously been trained into
strength on each of these, it will fail or grow weary.
The proper kind of preparation operates by exploring
the range of the voice, testing its capabilities, and improving
each tone. This work is not imitative or slavish.
It is only like putting an instrument in tune before beginning
a musical performance.</p>

<p class='c000'>To give full elocutionary instruction here would be
aside from our purpose; but a few useful modes of
practice may be pointed out.</p>

<p class='c000'>Good articulation is of prime importance. Nothing
will contribute more to secure this valuable quality than
the separation of words into their elements of sound
and continued practice on each element as thus isolated.
Phonetic shorthand affords a good means for making
such analysis, or the same purpose may be accomplished
by means of the marks of pronunciation found in any
dictionary. As we practice these elements of sound we
will discover the exact nature of any defect of articulation
we may suffer from, and can drill upon the sounds that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>are difficult until they become easy. When we have thus
learned to pronounce these few elements—not much
above forty in number—and can follow them into all
their combinations, we have mastered the alphabet of
utterance. It will also contribute greatly to strengthen
the voice and make it pliable, if we continue the same
practice on these elements at different degrees of elevation
on the musical scale until we can utter each one in full,
round distinctness, at any pitch from the deepest bass to
the shrillest note ever used in speech. This will bring
all varieties of modulation within easy reach.</p>

<p class='c000'>Practice on these elements is also a very effective mode
of strengthening weak voices. By pronouncing them
one by one, with gradually increasing force, the degree
of loudness we can attain at any pitch, will be greatly
extended. The amount of improvement that may be
made would be incredible if it were not so often exemplified.
Every teacher of elocution can testify of students,
the power of whose voices has thus been multiplied many
fold; and almost equal advantages may be reaped in
persevering private practice.</p>

<p class='c000'>Following on the same line, we may learn to enunciate
the elements, and especially the short vowels, in a quick,
sharp tone, more rapidly than the ticking of a watch,
and with the clearness of a bell. This will enable the
speaker to avoid drawling, and be very fast when desirable,
without falling into indistinctness. Then, by an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>opposite process, other sounds, especially the long vowels,
may be prolonged with every degree of force from the
faintest to the fullest. Perseverance in these two exercises
will so improve the voice that no hall will be too
large for its compass.</p>

<p class='c000'>The differing extension of sounds, as well as their
pitch and variations in force, constitute the <em>perspective</em>
of speech and give it an agreeable variety, like the
mingling of light and shade in a well-executed picture.
The opposite of this, a dull, dead uniformity, with
each word uttered in the same key, with the same force,
and at the same degree of speed, becomes well-nigh unbearable;
while perpetual modulation, reflecting in each
rise and fall, each storm and calm of sound, the living
thought within, is the perfection of nature, which the
best art can only copy.</p>

<p class='c000'>All vocal exercises are of an essentially preparatory
character. In the moment of speech details may safely
be left to the impulse of nature. Supply the capability
by previous discipline, and then allow passion to clothe
itself in the most natural forms. There is such a vital
connection between emotion and the tones of voice, that
emphasis and inflection will be as spontaneous, on the
part of the disciplined speaker, as breathing. Rules
remembered in the act of speaking tend to destroy all
life and freshness of utterance.</p>

<p class='c000'>When bad habits have been corrected, the voice made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>supple and strong, confidence attained, and deep feeling
evoked in the speaker’s breast, there will be little need
to care for the minutiæ of elocution. The child that is
burnt needs no instruction in the mode of crying out.
Let nature have her way, untrammeled by art, and all
feelings will dominate the voice and cause every hearer
to recognize their nature and participate in them. In
this way we may not attain the brilliancy of theatric
clap-trap, but we will be able to give “the touch of
nature that makes the whole world kin.”</p>

<p class='c000'>If carefully guarded, the faculty of imitation may be
of great service in the management of the voice. The
sounds that express sympathy and passion are heard
everywhere, forming a medium of communication more
subtle and widespread than any language of earth. From
the example of great orators we may learn what true
excellence is, and become able to reproduce some, at
least, of their effects. It would be hurtful to confine our
attention too long to one model, for true excellence is
many-sided, and if we continually view only one of its
phases we are apt to fall into slavish imitation—one of
the greatest of all vices. By having many examples to
look upon, and using them only to elevate our own ideal,
we will escape this danger. The models before us will
urge us to greater exertions and the whole level of our
attainments be raised.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are abundant faults to mar the freedom and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>naturalness of delivery, and the speaker who would be
truly natural must watch diligently for them and
exterminate them without mercy. The sing-song tone,
the scream, the lisp, the guttural and tremulous tones,
the rhythmical emphasis which falls like a trip-hammer
at measured intervals, are specimens of common, bad
habits that should be weeded out as fast as they push
through the soil; and if the speaker’s egotism is too great to
see them, or his taste not pure enough, some friend should
point them out. Even the advice of an enemy conveyed in
the unpleasant form of sarcasm and ridicule may be profitably
used for the purpose of reform and improvement.</p>

<p class='c000'>Should a conversational tone be employed in speaking?
This question has often been asked, and much difference
of opinion evoked, but it may be satisfactorily
answered. The language of conversation is the language
of nature in its most unfettered form, and it should,
therefore, be the <em>basis</em> of all speech. The same variety
and character of intonations used in it should be
employed in every variety of oratory. But conversation
itself varies widely with varying circumstances.
The man talking with a friend across a river will speak
less rapidly but more loudly than if he held that friend
by the hand. In speaking to a number at once, the
orator must, in order to be heard, speak more forcibly
and distinctly than in addressing one only. With this
explanation, it may be laid down as a safe rule that a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>speech should <em>begin</em> in a conversational manner. But
should it continue in the same way? A deep, full tone—the
orotund of the elocutionist—will make a stronger
impression than a shrill, feeble utterance. And as conversation
becomes earnest even between two persons,
there is the tendency to stronger and more impressive
tones. This same tendency will be a sufficient guide in
speech. A trained man giving utterance to a well-prepared
speech, upon a theme which appeals to his own
emotions, will adopt those oratorical tones which form a
proper medium for eloquence, without a single thought
given to that subject during the moment of delivery.
Begin as a man who is talking to a number of his friends
upon an interesting subject; then, as the interest deepens,
let go all restraint. As passion rises like an inflowing
tide, the voice will be so fully possessed by it and so
filled out and strengthened as to produce all the effect
of which its compass is capable. It will deepen into the
thunder roll when that is needed, and at the right time
will grow soft and pathetic.</p>

<p class='c000'>But above almost every other error that the speaker
can commit, beware of thinking that you must be loud
in order to be impressive. Nothing is more disgusting
than that interminable roar, beginning with a shout, and
continuing to split the speaker’s throat and the hearer’s
ears all through the discourse. This fault is not uncommon
in the pulpit, especially among those who desire a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>reputation for extraordinary fervor and earnestness.
But it is the worst kind of monotony. The loudness of
tone, that applied at the right place would be overpowering,
loses all power except to disgust and weary an audience.
It expresses no more thought or sentiment than
the lashing of ocean waves conveys to the storm-tossed
mariner. Have something to say; keep the fires of
passion burning in your own soul; learn the real strength
there is in the reserve of power; and the cultivated voice
will not fail in its only legitimate office—that of making
the clear and adequate impression of your thoughts and
emotions upon the souls of others.</p>

<p class='c000'>Elocutionary manuals properly devote much space to
the consideration of gesture, for the eye should be
addressed and pleased as well as the ear. But we doubt
whether the marking out of special gestures to be imitated
can do much good. A few broad principles like
those formulated by the celebrated French teacher, Delsarte,
may be profitably studied and made familiar by
practice upon a few simple selections. After that the
principal use of training is to give confidence so that the
speaker may be in the full possession and instinctive use
of all his powers. Fear often freezes the speaker into
ice-like rigidity; and hearers are apt to feel the same
deadly chill when listening to some one whose dominating
sentiment is the fear that he may do something ridiculous,
or fail to win their favor.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>The secondary use of training in gesture is to discard
awkward and repulsive movements. Timidity and fear
may be overcome by a firm resolution, and the object is
well worth the effort. Bad or ungraceful actions are far
better in the case of a beginner than no action at all.
The saying of Demosthenes, that the first, the second,
and the third need of an orator is “<span class='fss'>ACTION</span>,” does not
fully apply to the modern speaker. He needs many
things more urgently than action, even when that word
is taken in its widest sense. But action is important, and
when graceful and expressive, it does powerfully tend to
arrest attention, and even to help the processes of thought
on the part of the speaker himself. We have heard several
eloquent men who scarcely moved during the
delivery of an address, but never without feeling that
good gesticulation would have been a great addition to
their power. It is unnatural to speak for any considerable
period of time without moving. None but a lazy,
sick, or bashful man will do it. Let the laziness be
shaken off, the sickness cured, and the bashfulness
reserved for a more fitting occasion! A man who is too
bashful and diffident to move hand, head, or foot in the
presence of an audience should in consistency refuse to
monopolize their time at all!</p>

<p class='c000'>Practice will usually overcome this fault. When a
man has stood a great many times before an audience
without receiving any serious injury, and has a good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>purpose in thus claiming their attention, and something
which he thinks they ought to hear, he will forget his
fears and allow his mind to be engrossed, as that of a
true speaker should be, with the subject he has in hand.
Then all his gestures will have at least the grace of unconscious
and spontaneous origination.</p>

<p class='c000'>But when fear has been overcome so that the speaker
is not afraid to use his hands, he needs to enter upon a
determined and comprehensive campaign against bad
habits. If anything is truly natural—that is, true to
the higher or universal nature—it will be beautiful; but
early examples are so often wrong and corrupting that
it is hard to say what nature is: Nature may be a bad
nature—the reflection of all that is low and sordid as
well as that which is high and ennobling. That nature
which is in harmony with the sum of all things, which
is the image of the Creator’s perfectness, must be right
and good; but we must not too hastily conclude that any
habits of our own have this high and unquestionable
source. Hardly a speaker lives who does not at some
time fall into unsightly or ridiculous habits. The difference
between men in this respect is that some steadily
accumulate all the faults they ever have contracted, until
the result is most repulsive; while others, from the warnings
of friends or their own observation, discover their
errors and cast them off.</p>

<p class='c000'>A mode by which the solitary student may become
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>acquainted with his faults, and from which he should not
be driven by foolish ridicule, is by declaiming in as
natural and forcible a manner as possible before a large
mirror. Thus we may “see ourselves as others see us.”
Repeated practice in this manner will enable you to keep
the necessary watch upon your motions, without so much
distracting attention as to make the exercise before the
glass no trustworthy specimen of ordinary habits. In
speaking, you hear your own voice and thus become sensible
of audible errors, but the glass is required to show
improper movements that may have been unconsciously
contracted. It is not advised that each speech, before
delivery, should be practiced in front of the mirror. It
is doubtful if such practice would not cherish a self-consciousness
worse than all the errors it corrected. But
the same objection would not apply to occasional declamations
made for the very purpose of self-criticism.</p>

<p class='c000'>By these two processes—pressing out into action as
freely as possible under the impulse of deep feeling, and
by lopping off everything that is not graceful and effective—we
may soon attain a good style of gesture.
When the habit of suiting the action to the word is once
fully formed, all anxiety on that subject may be dismissed.
The best gesticulation is entirely unconscious.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER X.<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>Confidence.</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>How may that boldness and confidence which is indispensable
to an orator best be acquired? On your success
in this direction, hinges all other kinds of improvement.
So long as a nervous dread hangs about you, it will make
the practice of extemporaneous speech painful and repulsive,
paralyzing all your faculties in the moment of
utterance.</p>

<p class='c000'>You must acquire confidence in your own powers
and be willing to trust to their guidance.</p>

<p class='c000'>But it is not necessary that you should exhibit or
even feel this confidence at the beginning of a speech, for
it may then appear like boastfulness or egotism. It is
enough if you then have confidence in your subject, and
in the fullness of your preparation. You may then without
injury wish that some one, that you imagine more
worthy, stood in your place. But if this feeling continues
all through the address, failure is inevitable. Many
a man begins while trembling in every limb, especially
if the occasion be of unusual character, but soon becomes
inspired with his theme and forgets all anxiety. If your
fear be greater and more persistent, keeping you in perpetual
terror, it will destroy all liberty and eloquence.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>When laboring under such an influence, you lose self-possession,
become confused, all interest evaporates from your
most carefully prepared thoughts, and you sit down at
length, convinced that you have failed. It is but little
consolation to believe that you had all the time in your
brain the necessary power and material to achieve splendid
success, if you had but possessed the courage to use it
aright.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is no remedy for fear more effectual than to do
all our work under the immediate inspiration of duty.
This feeling is not the privilege of the minister alone,
but of each one who is conscious that he occupies the place
where he stands because it is his right to be there, because
he has some information to give, some cause to
advocate, or some important task to do. With such
consciousness we can speak our best, and finish with
the satisfaction of having done our work as truly as if
we had performed duty placed upon us in any other
department of labor. But if we aim simply at making
an exhibition of self and of showing our own skill and
eloquence, then the smiles and frowns of the audience
becomes a matter of overwhelming importance, and if
we fail we are deeply mortified and bewail our foolishness
in exposing ourselves to such needless risk.</p>

<p class='c000'>The lack of proper confidence is the great reason for
using manuscript in the moment of speech. The speaker
makes one effort to extemporize and fails. This is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>wonderful, for the path to success usually lies through
failure from the time that we master the wonderful art
of walking through many failures; but instead of copying
the schoolboy motto, “try, try again,” and reaping wisdom
and experience from past efforts, he loses all hope—concludes
that he is disqualified for that kind of work,
and thus sinks to mediocrity and tameness, when he
might have been brilliant in the fields of true oratory.</p>

<p class='c000'>The exhibition of confidence and resolution by the
speaker is a draft drawn on the respect of an audience
which is nearly always honored, while the opposite
qualities hide the possession of real talent. Hearers
readily pardon timidity at the beginning of an address,
for then attention is fixed upon the speaker himself, and
his shrinking seems a graceful exhibition of modesty.
But when he has fully placed his subject before them
they associate him with it. If he is dignified and
assured, they listen in pleased attention and acknowledge
the weight of his words. These qualities are very different
from bluster and bravado, which injure the cause
advocated and excite disgust toward the speaker. The
first appears to arise from a sense of the dignity of the
subject; the second, from an assumption of personal
superiority—an opinion no speaker has a right to entertain,
for in the very act of addressing an audience he
constitutes them his judges.</p>

<p class='c000'>An orator needs confidence in his own powers in order
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>to avail himself fully of the suggestions of the moment.
Some of the best thoughts he will ever think flash upon
him while speaking, and are out of the line of his preparation.
There is no time to carefully weigh them. He
must reject them immediately or begin to follow, not
knowing whither they lead, and this in audible words,
with the risk that he may be landed in some absurdity.
He cannot pause for a moment, as the least hesitation
breaks the spell he has woven around his hearers, while
if he rejects the offered idea he may lose a genuine inspiration.
One searching glance that will not allow time
for his own feelings or those of his auditors to cool, and
then—decision to reject, or to follow the new track with
the same assurance as if the end were clearly in view—this
is all that is possible. It requires some boldness to
pursue the latter course, and yet every speaker knows
that his highest efforts—efforts that have seemed beyond
his normal power, and which have done more in a
minute to gain the object for which he spoke than all
the remainder of the discourse—have been of this
character.</p>

<p class='c000'>It also requires a good degree of confidence to firmly
begin a sentence, even when the general idea is plain,
without knowing just how it will end. This difficulty
is experienced sometimes even by the most fluent. A
man may learn to cast sentences very rapidly, but it will
take a little time to pass them through his mind, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>when one is finished, the next may not yet have fully
condensed itself into words. To begin to utter a partially
constructed sentence, uncertain how it will end, and press
on without letting the people see any hesitation, demands
no small confidence in one’s power of commanding words
and framing sentences. Yet a bold and confident speaker
need feel no uneasiness. He may prolong a pause while
he is thinking of a needed word, or throw in something
extraneous to fill up the time till the right term and construction
are found. Yet the perfect remedy for these
dangers is to learn the difficult art of standing before an
audience with nothing to say and making the pause as
effective as any phase of speech. This can be done, dangerous
as it seems. It does require far more of courage
to face an audience when the mouth is empty than when
we are talking; the mettle of troops is never so severely
tried as when their cartridge-boxes are empty; but all
the resources of eloquence are not at command until this
test can be calmly and successfully endured. An eminent
speaker once said to a friend after a very successful
effort, “What part of the address you have been praising
most impressed you?” “It was not anything you
<em>said</em>,” was the reply, “but the thrilling <em>pause</em> you made
of nearly half a minute after a bold assertion, as if you
were challenging any one to rise and deny what you had
asserted.” “Oh! I remember,” returned the other; “I
could not get the next sentence fixed quite right, and was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>fully determined not to say it at all unless it came into
the proper shape.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This necessary confidence can be cultivated by striving
to exercise it, and by assuming its appearance where the
reality is not. The raw recruit is transformed into a
veteran soldier by meeting and overcoming danger. All
the drill in the world will not supply the want of actual
experience on the battle-field. So the extempore speaker
must make up his mind to accept all the risk, and
patiently endure all the failures and perils that result.
If he fully decides that the reward is worthy of the
effort he will be greatly aided in the attempt, as he will
thus avoid the wavering and shrinking and questioning
that would otherwise distress him and paralyze his powers.
A failure will but lead to stronger and more persistent
effort, made with added experience. Success will
be an argument for future confidence, and thus any
result will forward him on his course.</p>

<p class='c000'>In regard to the difficulty of framing sentences in
the moment of utterance, the experienced speaker will
become so expert, having found his way through so
many difficulties of that kind, that the greatest danger
experienced will be that of carelessly allowing his words
to flow on without unity or polish. It does require a
determined effort, not merely to <em>express</em> meaning, but to
pack and <em>compress</em> the greatest possible amount into
striking and crystalline words. Experience also gives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>him such a knowledge of the working of his own
thoughts that he will be able to decide at the first suggestion
what unbidden ideas should be accepted and what
ones should be rejected. If these new thoughts, however
far outside of his preparation, seem worthy, he will
give them instant expression; if not, he will dismiss
them and continue unchecked along his intended route.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is hoped that the reading of this treatise will increase
the confidence of extempore speakers in two ways;
first, by producing in the mind of each one perfect conviction
that for him the better way is to adopt unwritten
speech without reserve; and second, by pointing out a
mode of preparation which will give as good ground for
confidence as a fully written manuscript could possibly
supply. To gain confidence which is not warranted by
the event would only provoke a hurtful reaction; but
confidence which is justified by experience grows ever
stronger.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have thus glanced at a few of the qualities which
need to be cultivated and strengthened for the purposes
of public speech. The survey does not cover the whole
field of desirable qualities, for this would be to give a
treatise on general education. Perfect speech requires
every faculty of the mind to be brought to the highest
state of efficiency. There is no mental power which will
not contribute to success. The whole limits of possible
education are comprised in the two branches already mentioned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>as concerning the orator—those relating to the
<em>reception</em> of knowledge and those to its <em>communication</em>.
The harmonious combination and perfect development
of these two is the ideal of excellence—an ideal so high
that it can only be approached. All knowledge is of use
to the orator. He may not have occasion to employ it
in a particular speech, but it contributes to give certainty,
breadth, and scope to his views, and assures him that
what he does put into his speeches is the best that can
be selected. If he is ignorant, he is obliged to use for a
discourse on any subject not that material which is the
best in itself, but simply the best that may happen to be
known to him, and he cannot be sure that something far
more suitable is not overlooked.</p>

<p class='c000'>The communicating faculties are, if possible, still more
important. A great part of the value even of a diamond
depends upon its polish and setting, and the richest and
wisest thoughts fail to reach the heart or captivate the
intellect unless they are cast into the proper form, and
given external beauty.</p>

<p class='c000'>Let the speaker, then, have no fear of knowing too
much. Neither need he despair if he does not now know
a great deal. He cannot be perfect at once, but must
build for future years. If he wishes a sudden and local
celebrity that will never widen, but will probably molder
away even in his own lifetime, he may possibly gain it in
another way. Let him learn a few of the externals of elocution,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>and then, with great care, or by the free use of the
materials of others, prepare a few finely worded discourses,
and recite or declaim them over and over again
as often as he can find a new audience. He may not
gain as much applause as he desires by this method,
but it will be sufficiently evanescent. He will not grow
up to the measure of real greatness, but become daily
more dwarfed and stereotyped in intellect.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following quotation contains a good example of
the seductive but misleading methods sometimes held up
before the young orator: “They talk,” said Tom Marshall
to an intimate friend, “of my astonishing bursts
of eloquence, and doubtless imagine it is my genius bubbling
over. It is nothing of the sort. I’ll tell you how
I do it: I select a subject and study it from the ground
up. When I have mastered it fully, I write a speech
on it. Then I take a walk and come back, and revise
and correct. In a few days I subject it to another
pruning, and then recopy it. Next I add the finishing
touches, round it off with graceful periods, and commit
it to memory. Then I speak it in the fields, in my
father’s lawn, and before my mirror, until gesture and
delivery are perfect. It sometimes takes me six weeks
or two months to get up a speech. When I am prepared
I come to town. I generally select a court day, when
there is sure to be a crowd. I am called on for a speech,
and am permitted to select my own subject. I speak my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>piece. It astonishes the people, as I intended it should,
and they go away marveling at my power of oratory.
They call it genius, but it is the hardest kind of work.”</p>

<p class='c000'>No objection is made to the quantity of work thus
described, but might not the same amount be expended
in more profitable directions? A speech thus prepared
was a mere trick intended to astonish the people. Sometimes
the great Daniel Webster took equal pains in the
verbal expression of some worthy thought, which was
afterward held in the grasp of a powerful memory until
a fitting place was found for it in some masterly speech.
The difference between the two processes is greater than
seems at first glance. Marshall’s plan was like a beautiful
garment thrown over a clothes dummy in a shop
window; Webster’s, like the same garment, worn for
comfort and ornament by a living man.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is better that the speaker should “intermeddle with
all knowledge,” and make the means of communicating
his thoughts as perfect as possible. Then out of the
fullness of his treasure, let him talk to the people with
an adequate purpose in view, and if no sudden acclaim
greets him, he will be weighty and influential from the
first, and each passing year will add to his power.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XI.<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>The Pen and the Tongue.</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It does not follow from anything we have said that
the pen should be discarded by the extempore speaker.
Because he is not obliged to write each word, he should
not feel excused from writing altogether. Few greater
misfortunes could happen to a speaker than being
deprived of the power of recording and preserving notes
for the purposes of oratory. The most tenacious memory
is burdened by the weight of a large number of
intended discourses, especially if they are long and complex.
No person can feel sure that he will remember
all parts of the speech he intended to utter even in outline,
unless it has been reduced to regular form so that
one part will suggest another. In going to a store to
purchase a few articles the pen is very useful in making
a memorandum; if the errand boy neglects that precaution
some of the most essential things may be forgotten.
Among illiterate people a great many mnemonic signs
have been employed, such as associating things to be
remembered with the fingers, etc.; but among intelligent
persons all of these have been superseded by the use of
writing, and it would be very absurd to advocate a
return to the old modes on the plea that the memory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>might be so strengthened that all items could be safely
remembered. The reply would be ready: “Yes, it is
possible; but we have a far better and less burdensome
way of accomplishing the same object and have no
motive in returning to the more difficult mode.” Thus
while it may be possible to arrange in the mind all the
outlines of a long discourse, it is not easy to do it, and
there is no gain in the extra labor involved. Everything
bearing upon a discourse may be written in brief outline,
and then a selection made of what is best, throwing out
all other portions. The remainder can then be far better
arranged when in such a position that the eye as well
as the mind can glance at it. The preparation for the
intended speech thus assumes the shape of a miniature
or outline, and may be filled out at any point which
needs strengthening.</p>

<p class='c000'>But even if it were possible to construct the plan and
speak well without any previous use of the pen, this
would, in the majority of cases, be insufficient. The
orator needs to preserve the materials, if not the form of
his oration, either for use in future speeches or for comparison
with later efforts. It is very wasteful to throw
away valuable material once accumulated, and then
search the same ground over again when required to
treat the same topic. This would be acting in the spirit of
the savage who eats enough to satisfy his appetite and
throws away all that remains, as he feels no further need
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>for it, and only begins to gather again when hunger
spurs him to exertion.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pen is the instrument of accumulation and preservation,
and should be diligently employed. No speaker
can rise to permanent greatness without it. The instances
given to the contrary are mere delusions or
evasions. If the service of other pens can be employed,
as in the case of shorthand reporters and
amanuenses, this is but doing the same thing under
another form.</p>

<p class='c000'>The principal purpose of the chapters that follow
is to show how the pen may be used in such a
manner as to preserve and arrange all the material we
may gather, elaborate, or originate on any subject,
so as to bring to the moment of unfettered extempore
speech all the certainty of result and accumulated power
of which our faculties are capable.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bacon says: “Reading makes a full man, writing an
exact man, and conference a ready man.” All these
means should be used and all these qualities attained by
the eloquent speaker.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XII.<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>Subject and Object.</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>We now enter upon the most practical part of our
subject. We have seen what natural qualities are indispensable,
and how these, when possessed, can be improved
by training. The importance of a wide scope of knowledge
bearing upon oratory, and of understanding and
having some command of the powers of language has
been pointed out. When a man has all of these, and is
still a diligent student growing daily in knowledge, he
is ready to consider the methods by which all his gifts
and acquirements may be concentrated upon a single
speech. Some of the directions in this and the immediately
succeeding chapters are of universal application,
while others are thrown out as mere suggestions to be
modified and changed according to individual taste or
particular circumstances.</p>

<p class='c000'>A plan is necessary for every kind of speech. A rude
mass of brick, lumber, mortar, and iron, thrown together
as the materials chance to be furnished, does not constitute
a house until each item is built into its own place
according to some intelligent design. A speech has the
same need of organization. A few minutes of desultory
talk, whether uttered in a low or high voice, to one person
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>or to many, does not make a speech. The talk may be
good, or useful, or striking: it may be replete with sparkling
imagery, and full of valuable ideas that command
attention, and yet be no real discourse. The question,
“What was all this about? what end did the speaker have
in view?” is a fatal condemnation. The subject and
object of every discourse should be perfectly obvious—if
not at the opening, surely at the close of the address.
The only safe method is to have a well-defined plan
marked out from beginning to end, and then to bring
every part of the work into subordination to one leading
idea. The plan itself should be constructed with some
clear object in view.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is better that this construction of the plan should
be completed before delivery begins. If you are suddenly
called to speak on some topic you have often
thought over, the whole outline of the address, with a
plan perfect in every part, may flash upon you in a
moment, and you may speak as well as if you had been
allowed months for preparation. But such cases are rare
exceptions. The man who attempts, on the spur of the
moment, to arrange his facts, draw his inferences, and enforce
his opinions, will usually find the task very difficult,
even if the topic is within his mental grasp, and his memory
promptly furnishes him with all necessary materials.</p>

<p class='c000'>We will now consider the <em>subject</em> and <em>object</em> which
every true discourse, whatever its character, must possess.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>First, as to the object: why is it that at a particular
time an audience assembles and sits in silence, while one
man standing up, talks to them? What is his motive in
thus claiming their attention? Many of them may have
come from mere impulse, of which they could give no
rational explanation, but the speaker at least should have
a definite purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'>A clear aim tends powerfully to give unity and consistency
to the whole discourse, and to prevent him from
wandering into endless digressions. It binds all detached
parts together and infuses a common life through his
address. Such a ruling aim cannot be too definitely
recognized and carefully kept in view, for it is the foundation
of the whole discourse.</p>

<p class='c000'>This object should not be too general in character. It
is not enough that we wish to please or to do good: it
may be safely assumed that speakers generally wish to
do both. But how shall these ends be reached?
“What special good do I hope to accomplish by this
address?”</p>

<p class='c000'>When you have made the object definite, you are better
prepared to adapt all available means to its accomplishment.
It should also be stated that the more
objects are subdivided the more precision will be augmented,
though there is a limit beyond which such
division would be at the expense of other qualities.</p>

<p class='c000'>Your object will usually have reference to the opinion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>or the action of those addressed, and the firmer your
own conviction of the truth of that opinion, or the desirableness
of that action, the greater, other things being
equal, your persuasive power will be. If you do not
know exactly what you wish, there is little probability
that your audience will care to interpret your thought;
they will take it for granted that you really mean nothing,
and even if you do incidentally present some truth
supported by good arguments, they will consider it a matter
not calling for any immediate consideration or definite
decision on their part.</p>

<p class='c000'>The speaker’s objects are comparatively few and are
often determined by his very position and employment.
If you are engaged in a political canvass you are seeking
to confirm and retain the votes of your own party,
while persuading over to your side the opposition.
Votes constitute the object you seek, and to win them is
your purpose. But there are many ways by which that
desirable end may be accomplished—some wise and
noble, others ignoble. But a political orator will gain
in power by keeping clearly in view his purpose and
rejecting from his speeches all things that merely arouse
and embitter opponents, without, at the same time, contributing
to strengthen the hold of the speaker’s own
party upon its members.</p>

<p class='c000'>If you are a lawyer you wish to win your case. The
judge’s charge, the jury’s verdict, are your objective points,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>and all mere display which does not contribute directly
or indirectly to these ends is worse than wasted, as it may
even interfere with your real purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'>Much of your success will depend upon keeping the
right object before you at the right time. If you aim
at that which is unattainable, the effort is not only lost,
but the object which you could have reached may in the
meantime have passed out of your reach. Everybody
has heard ministers arguing against some forms of unbelief
which their hearers know nothing about. This is
worse than useless; it may suggest the very errors intended
to be refuted; and if this does not result, to think
that the refutation will be stored up until the time when
the errors themselves may be encountered, is to take a
most flattering view of the length of time during which
sermons as well as other discourses are remembered.
You may avoid these errors by selecting some object
which is practicable at the moment of utterance: the
first right step makes all after success possible.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is a difference between the object of a speech
and its subject; the former is the motive that impels us
to speak, while the latter is what we speak about. It is
not uncommon for talkers to have a subject without any
definite object, unless it be the very general one of complying
with a form or fulfilling an engagement. When
the period for the talk comes—it would not be right to
call it a speech—they take the easiest subject they can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>find, express all the ideas they happen to have about
it, and leave the matter. Until such persons become in
earnest, and get a living object, true eloquence is utterly
impossible.</p>

<p class='c000'>The object of a discourse is the soul, while the subject
is but the body; or, as we may say, the one is the end,
while the other is the means by which it is accomplished.
After the object is clearly realized by the speaker, he can
choose the subject to much better advantage. It may
happen that one object is so much more important than
all other practicable ones that it forces itself irresistibly
on his attention and thus saves the labor of choice; at
other times he may have several different objects with
no particular reason for preferring one of them in the
order of time to another. In this case if a subject fills
his mind it will be well to discuss it with an aim toward
the object which may be best enforced by its means.</p>

<p class='c000'>After all, it makes but little difference which of these
two is chosen first. It is enough that when you undertake
to speak you have a subject you fully understand,
and an object that warms your heart and enlists all your
powers. You can then speak, not as one who deals with
abstractions, but as having a living mission to perform.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is important that each subject should be complete
in itself, and rounded off from everything else. Its
boundaries should be run with such precision as to
include all that belongs to it, but nothing more. It is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>common but grievous fault to have the same cast of
ideas flowing around every subject. There are few
things in the universe which have not some relation to
everything else. If we do not, therefore, very strictly
bound our subject, we will find ourselves bringing the
same matter into each discourse and perpetually repeating
our thoughts. If ingenious in that matter, we may find
a good excuse for getting our favorite anecdotes and
brilliant ideas into connection with the most opposite
kinds of subjects. An old minister once gave me an
amusing account of the manner in which he made outlines
of the sermons of a local celebrity. The first one
was a very able discourse, with three principal divisions—man’s
fallen estate, the glorious means provided for his
recovery, and the fearful consequences of neglecting
those means. Liking the sermon very well, my informant
went to hear the same man again. The text was
new, but the first proposition, was man’s fallen estate;
the second, the glorious means provided for his recovery;
and the last, the fearful consequences of neglecting those
means. Thinking that the repetition was an accident,
another trial was made. The text was at as great a
remove as possible from the other two. The first proposition
was, <em>man’s fallen estate</em>; and the others followed
in due order. This was an extreme instance of a common
fault, which is by no means confined to the ministry.
When an eloquent Congressman was once delivering a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>great address, a member on the opposite benches rubbed
his hands in apparently ecstatic delight, and remarked in
a stage whisper, “Oh! how I have always loved to hear
that speech!” In a book of widely circulated sermon
sketches, nearly every one begins by asserting that man
has fallen and needs the helps or is liable to the evils
mentioned afterward. No doubt this primary statement
is important, but it might sometimes be taken for
granted. The fault which we have here pointed out is
not uncommon in preaching. Occasionally ministers
acquire such a stereotyped form of expression that what
they say in one sermon is sure to recur, perhaps in a
modified form, in all others. This is intolerable. There
is an end to the patience of man. He tires of the same
old ideas, and wishes, when a new text is taken, that it
may bring with it some novelty in the sermon. The
remedy against the evil under consideration is found in
the careful selection and definition of subjects. Give to
each its own territory and guard rigidly against all trespassers.
A speaker should not only see that what he
says has some kind of connection with the subject in
hand, but that it has a closer connection with that subject
than any other he may be called upon to discuss at or
near the same time. A very great lecturer advertises a
number of lectures upon topics that seem to be totally
independent. Yet all the lectures are but one, except a
few paragraphs in the introduction of each. This is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>really a less fault in the case of an itinerating lecturer
than in most other fields of oratory, as the same people
hear the lecture but once. Yet even then the false
assumption of intellectual riches implied in the numerous
titles cannot be justified.</p>

<p class='c000'>The subject should be so well defined that we always
know just what we are speaking about. It may be of
a general nature, but our knowledge of it should be clear
and adequate. This is more necessary in an extempore
than in a written speech, though the want of it will be
severely felt in the latter also. A strong, vividly defined
subject will give unity to the whole discourse, and probably
leave a permanent impression on the mind of the
hearer. To aid in securing this it will be well to reduce
every subject to its simplest form, and then, by writing
it as a compact phrase or sentence, stamp it on the mind,
and let it ring in every utterance; that is, let each word
aid in carrying out the central idea, or in leading up to
it. Those interminable discourses that begin anywhere
and lead nowhere, may be called speeches or sermons, by
courtesy, but they are not such.</p>

<p class='c000'>To always preserve this unity of theme and treatment
is not easy, and calls, often, for the exercise of
heroic self-denial. To see in the mind’s eye what we
know would please and delight listeners, pander to their
prejudices, or gain uproarious applause, and then turn
away with the words unspoken, merely because it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>foreign to our subject—this is as sore a trial as for a
miser on a sinking ship to abandon his gold. But it is
equally necessary, if we would not fall into grave rhetorical
errors. Any speech which is constructed on the
plan of putting into it all the wise or witty or pleasing
things the speaker can think of will be a mere mass of
more or less foolish talk. Shakespeare is often reproached
with having neglected the dramatic unities of
place and time; but he never overlooked the higher
unities of subject and object. These remarks do not
imply that illustration should be discarded or even used
sparingly. The whole realm of nature may be ransacked
for these gems, and if they do illustrate, they are often
better than statement or argument. If the thing to be
illustrated belongs to the subject, then every apt illustration
of it also belongs there.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is possible that men of genius may neglect the unity
of subject and object, and still succeed by sheer intellectual
force, as they might do under any other circumstances.
But ordinary men cannot with safety follow
the example of Sidney Smith. His hearers complained
that he did not “stick to his text,” and, that he might
reform the more easily, they suggested that he should
divide his sermons as other ministers did. He promised
to gratify them, and the next Sabbath, after reading his
text, he began: “We will divide our discourse this
morning into three parts: in the first place, we will go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span><em>up</em> to our text; in the second place, we will go <em>through</em>
it; and in the third place, we will go <em>from</em> it.” There
was general agreement that he succeeded best on the last
head, but preachers who are not confident of possessing
his genius had better confine themselves to the former
two.</p>

<p class='c000'>A true discourse is the orderly development of some
one thought or idea with so much clearness and power
that it may ever after live as a point of light in the
memory. Other ideas may cluster around the central
one, but it must reign supreme. If the discourse fails
in this particular nothing else can redeem it. Brilliancy
of thought and illustration will be as completely wasted
as a sculptor’s art on a block of clay.</p>

<p class='c000'>A man of profound genius once arose to preach before
a great assemblage, and every breath was hushed. He
spoke with power, and many of his passages were of
thrilling eloquence. He poured forth beautiful images
and solemn thoughts with the utmost profusion; yet
when at the end of an hour he took his seat, the prevailing
sentiment was one of disappointment. The address
was confused—utterly destitute of any point of union to
which the memory could cling. Many of his statements
were clear and impressive, but he did not make evident
what he was talking about. It was an impressive
warning against erecting a building before laying a
foundation.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIII.<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>Thought-gathering.</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>After the subject upon which we are to speak has been
determined the logical order of preparation is, first,
gathering material; second, selecting what is most fitting
and arranging the whole into perfect order; third, fixing
this in the mind so that it may be available for the
moment of use. These processes are not always separated
in practice, but they may be best considered in the
order indicated.</p>

<p class='c000'>When a subject is chosen and the mind fastened upon
it, that subject becomes a center of attraction and naturally
draws all kindred ideas toward it. Old memories
that had become dim from the lapse of time are slowly
hunted out and grouped around the parent thought.
Each hour of contemplation that elapses, even if there
is not direct study, adds to the richness and variety of
our available mental stores. The relations between different
and widely separated truths become visible, just as
new stars are seen when we gaze intently toward the
evening sky. All that lies within our knowledge is
subjected to a rigid scrutiny and all that appears to have
any connection with the subject is brought into view.
Usually a considerable period of time is needed for this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>process, and the longer it is continued the better, if interest
in the subject is not suffered to decline in the meanwhile.</p>

<p class='c000'>But it is somewhat difficult to continue at this work
long enough without weariness. The capacity for great
and continuous reaches of thought constitutes a principal
element in the superiority of one mind over another.
Even the mightiest genius cannot, at a single impulse,
exhaust the ocean of truth that opens around every
object of man’s contemplation. It is only by viewing a
subject in every aspect that superficial and one-sided
impressions can be guarded against. But the continuous
exertion and toil this implies are nearly always distasteful,
and the majority of men can only accomplish it by
a stern resolve. Whether acquired or natural, the
ability to completely “think out” a subject is of prime
necessity; the young student at the outset should learn
to finish every investigation he begins and continue the
habit during life. Doing this or not doing it will generally
be decisive of his success or failure from an intellectual
point of view. Thought is a mighty architect,
and if you keep him fully employed, he will build up
with slow and measured strokes a gorgeous edifice upon
any territory at all within your mental range. You
may weary of his labor and think that the wall rises so
slowly that it will never be completed; but wait. In
due time, if you are patient, all will be finished and will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>then stand as no ephemeral structure, to be swept away
by the first storm that blows, but will be established and
unshaken on the basis of eternal truth.</p>

<p class='c000'>M. Bautain compares the accumulation of thought
around a subject upon which the mind thus dwells with
the development of organic life by continuous growth
from an almost imperceptible germ. Striking as is the
analogy, there is one point of marked dissimilarity.
This growth of thought is voluntary and may easily be
arrested at any stage. The introduction of a new subject
or cessation of effort on the old is fatal. To prevent
this and keep the mind employed until its work is done
requires with most persons a regular and formal system.
Profound thinkers, who take up a subject and cannot
leave it until it is traced into all its intricate relations
and comprehended in every part, and who have at the
same time the power of easily recalling long trains of
thought that have once passed through their mind, have
less need of an artificial method. But their case is not
that of the majority of thinkers or speakers.</p>

<p class='c000'>We will give a method found useful for securing
abundant speech materials, and allow others to adopt it
as far as it may prove advantageous to them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The things we actually know are not always kept
equally in view. Sometimes we may see an idea with
great clearness and after a time lose it again, while
another, at first invisible, comes into sight. Each idea
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>should be secured when it occurs. Let each thought
that arises on the subject you intend to discuss be noted.
A word or a brief sentence sufficient to recall the conception
to your own mind will be enough, and no labor
need be expended on composition or expression. After
this first gathering, let the paper be laid aside and the
subject be recommitted to the mind for further reflection.
As other ideas arise let them be noted down in the same
manner and the process be thus continued for days
together. Sometimes new images and conceptions will
continue to float into the mind for weeks. Most persons
who have not tried this process of accumulation will be
surprised to find how many thoughts they have on the
simplest topic. If some of this gathered matter remains
vague and shadowy, it will only be necessary to give it
more time and more earnest thought and all obscurity
will vanish.</p>

<p class='c000'>At last there comes the consciousness that the mind’s
power on that particular theme is exhausted. If we
also feel that we have all the material needed, one step
further only remains in this part of the work; the comparison
of our treasures with what others have accomplished
in the same field. It may be that this comparison
will show the worthlessness of much of our own
material, but it is better to submit to the humiliation
involved and be sure that we have the best that can be
furnished by other minds as well as our own. If we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>prefer, we may speak when we have gathered only the
materials that are already within our own grasp and
thus have a greater consciousness of originality, but
such consciousness is a delusion unless based upon
exhaustive research. Nearly all that we thus gather
will be the result of previous reading, and almost the
only thing in its favor over the fresh accumulations that
we make by reading directly in the line of our subject,
is the probability that the former knowledge will be
better digested.</p>

<p class='c000'>But more frequently, after the young orator has recollected
and briefly noted all that bears upon his subject
with which his own mind furnishes him, there remains
a sense of incompleteness, and he is driven to seek a
further supply. He is now hungry for new information,
and on this state there is an intellectual blessing
corresponding to the moral blessing pronounced upon
those who hunger and thirst after righteousness. He
reads the works of those who have treated the same or
related topics, converses with well-informed persons,
observes the world closely, still putting down every new
idea that seems to bear upon his theme. Whenever an
idea is found which supplies a felt want, it is received
with great joy. It often happens that instead of finding
the very thing sought for he strikes upon the first link
of some chain of thoughts in his own mind that leads up
to what he desires, but has hitherto overlooked. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>new idea is only the more valued when it has thus been
traced out.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now, we have on paper, and often after much toil, a
number of confused, unarranged notes. They are destitute
of polish, and no more constitute a speech than the
piles of brick and lumber a builder accumulates constitute
a house. Indeed, this comparison is too favorable,
for the builder has carefully calculated just what he
needs for his house, and has ordered those very things.
But usually we have in our notes much that can be of
no use, and at whatever sacrifice of feeling it must be
thrown out. This is a matter of great importance. It
has been said that the principal difference between the
conversation of a wise man and of a fool is that the one
speaks all that is in his mind, while the other gives utterance
only to carefully selected thoughts. Nearly all
men have at times ideas that would please and profit any
audience; and if these are carefully weeded out from the
puerilities by which they may be surrounded, the remainder
will be far more valuable than the whole mass.
Everything not in harmony with the controlling object
or purpose must be thrown away at whatever sacrifice
of feeling. Read carefully your scattered notes after the
fervor of pursuit has subsided and erase every phrase
that is unfitting. If but little remains you can continue
the search as at first, and erase and search again, until
you have all that you need of matter truly relevant to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>the subject. Yet it is not well to be over-fastidious.
This would prevent speech altogether, or make the work
of preparation so slow and wearisome that when the
hour of effort arrived, all freshness and vigor would be
gone. A knight in Spenser’s “Faery Queen” entered
an enchanted castle and as he passed through eleven
rooms in succession he saw written on the walls of each
the words, “Be bold;” but on the twelfth the inscription
changed to the advice of equal wisdom, “Be not too
bold.” The same injunctions are appropriate to the
orator. He should be careful in the selection of his
material, but not too careful. Many things which a
finical taste might reject are allowable and very effective.
No definite rule, however, can be given on the subject,
as it is a matter of taste rather than of calculation.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIV.<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>Constructing a Plan.</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The thoughts which have been gathered in the modes
pointed out in the last chapter are now to be arranged
in the most effective order. It will not usually do to
begin a speech with those things we happen to first
think of, and proceed to others that are less obvious.
This would lead to an anti-climax fatal to eloquence.
A speaker who adopted this mode once complained
that his speeches often seemed to taper to a very fine
point, and that he lost all interest in them before finishing.
The explanation was simple; he uttered first those
thoughts which were familiar to himself and came afterward
to those which had been sought out by more or
less painful effort, and which seemed less certain and
valuable. The remedy for this fault is found in careful
arrangement. The most familiar thoughts will
naturally be jotted down first, but it does not follow
that they should occupy the same place in the finished
plan of the speech.</p>

<p class='c000'>The true mode of improving your plans is to bestow
a great deal of time and thought upon them, and to
make no disposition of any part for which you cannot
give a satisfactory reason. This direction relates only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>to the beginner. In time the formation of plans will
become so natural that any variation from the most
effective arrangement will be felt as keenly as a discord
in music is felt by a master in that art. From such
carefully constructed plans, firm, coherent, and logical
discourses will result.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are certain general characteristics that each plan
should possess. It must fully indicate the nature of the
proposed discourse and mark out each of its successive
steps with accuracy. Any want of definiteness in the
outline is a fatal defect. You must feel that you can
rely absolutely on it for guidance to the end of your
discourse or be always in danger of embarrassment and
confusion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Each clause should express a distinct idea, and but
one. This should be repeated in no other part of the
discourse; otherwise, we fall into wearisome repetitions,
the great vice, as it is often claimed, of extempore
speakers.</p>

<p class='c000'>A brief plan is better, other things being equal, than
a long one. Often a single word will recall an idea as
perfectly as many sentences, and it will burden the
memory less. We do not expect the draft of a house to
equal the house in size, but only to preserve a proportionate
relation to it throughout. The plan cannot
supply the thought, but, indicating what is in the mind,
it shows how to bring it forth in regular succession. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>is a pathway leading to a definite end, and, like all pathways,
its crowning merits are directness and smoothness.
Without these qualities it will perplex and hinder rather
than aid. Each word in the plan should suggest an
idea, and be so firmly bound to that idea that the two
cannot become separated in any exigency of speech. You
will find it sorely perplexing if, in the heat of discourse,
some important note should lose the thought for which
it previously stood and become an empty word. But
with clear conceptions condensed into fitting words this
cannot easily happen. A familiar idea can be expressed
very briefly, while a strange or new conception may
require more expansion. But all thoughts advanced by
the speaker ought to be familiar to himself as the result
of long meditation and thorough mastery, no matter how
strange or startling they are to his hearers. Most skeletons
may be brought within the compass of a hundred
words, and every part be clearly indicated to the mind
that conceived it, though perhaps not to any other.</p>

<p class='c000'>There may be occasions when a speaker is justified in
announcing his divisions and subdivisions, but such
cases are exceptions. Hearers do not care how a discourse
is constructed, so it comes to them warm and
pulsating with life. To give the plan of a speech before
the speech itself is contrary to the order of nature. We
are not required first to look upon a grisly skeleton
before we can see a graceful, living body. There is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>skeleton inside each body, but during life it is well
hidden, and there is no reason that the speaker should
anticipate the work of the tomb. It is hardly less
objectionable to name the parts of the discourse during
the progress of the discussion, for—continuing the former
illustration—bones that project through the skin are
very unlovely. The only case, I presume to think,
where it is justifiable to name the parts of a discourse,
either before or during its delivery, is where the separate
parts have an importance of their own, in addition
to their office of contributing to the general object.
Much of the proverbial “dryness” of sermons arises
from the preacher telling what he is <em>about</em> to remark,
<em>firstly</em>, before he actually makes the remark thus numbered.
Whenever we hear a minister read his text,
announce his theme, state the parts into which he means
to divide it, and then warn us that the first head will be
subdivided into a certain number of parts, each of which
is also specified in advance, we prepare our endurance for
a severe test.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XV.<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>How Shall the Written Plan be Used?</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Now that the plan is completed and fully written out,
the next question arises as to what shall be done with
it. It may either be used or abused. To read it to
the audience or exhibit it to them would be an obvious
abuse. Possibly if the speaker possessed a large blackboard,
the latter course might, in special cases, have some
advantages. But even then it is better that the students
should, in most instances, exercise their own ingenuity
in gathering out of the body of the speech the central
thoughts which they wish to preserve in their notebooks,
than that the work should be done for them in
advance by having the whole plan of the lecture placed
in their sight.</p>

<p class='c000'>The writer has experimented on this subject by repeating
the same lecture to different classes with the outline in
some cases exposed to view, and in the others concealed:
the interest has always seemed to be greater, and the
understanding more complete in the latter case. If this
is true where instruction is the only aim, it is still more
necessary where persuasion is the object of the speaker.
The exposing in advance of the means by which he
intends to work, will put on their guard the very persons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>whose hearts he wishes to capture, and thus lose him
all that advantage of surprise which is often as momentous
in oratorical as in military affairs.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are two other ways of using the plan to be
considered. One is to keep it in the speaker’s sight, so
that he may step along from one item to another, thus
keeping a foundation of written words in the midst of
the uncertainty of his extemporaneous efforts, like that
afforded by stepping-stones to a man crossing a running
stream. There are some advantages in such use. The
speaker will feel freer in making those pauses which are
sometimes necessary for the sake of emphasis. He is
better able to collect his scattered ideas in case any
untoward circumstance should break the thread of his
discourse. If he is confused for a moment, he may look
down to his paper and recover himself, while if thoughts
and words flow easily he can ignore the plan which lies
before him.</p>

<p class='c000'>But all the reasons for thus using the plan are the
most emphatic condemnation of the practice. They are
all make-shifts. They are based upon the thought that
the great object is to secure the speaker from danger and
confusion; in other words, they put him on the defensive,
instead of the aggressive. Were the question to be
stated, “How can a man best preserve the form of extemporaneous
speech while shielding himself from the
most dangerous incidents of that mode of address?” it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>might plausibly be replied, “By making a very full plan
and concealing it at some point within the reach of his
eyes, and using it whenever that course becomes easiest.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But we have not sought to point out the mode of
speech which will best protect the speaker from risks
incident to his work. For real effectiveness, compromises
are usually hurtful, and this expedient forms no
exception.</p>

<p class='c000'>To have a plan in sight tends powerfully to break up
the speech into fragments and destroy its unity. A
series of short addresses on related points, affords no substitute
for a concentrated discourse. The speaker who
publicly uses his sketch, speaks on until he reaches a
point at which he does not know what is to come next,
and on the brink of that gulf, looks down at his notes,
and, perhaps after a search, finds what he wants. Had
the thought existed in his mind, it would have blended
the close of the preceding sentences into harmony with
it. Direct address to the people, which they so much
value in a speaker, is interfered with in the same way,
for his eye must rest for a portion of the time upon his
notes. He will also be apt to mention the divisions of
his speech as they occur, because the eye is resting upon
them at the same time the tongue is engaged, and it is
hard to keep the two members from working in harmony.</p>

<p class='c000'>If notes must be used the same advice applies that we
have already offered to those who read in full. Be honest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>about it; do not try to hide the notes. Any attempt to
prove to an audience that we are doing what we are not
doing, has in it an element of deception, and is morally
objectionable. The use of notes is not wrong, but to use
them while pretending not to use them is wrong.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some speakers carry their notes in their pockets for
the sake of being able to take them out in case they find
their memory failing, and thus they guard against the
misfortune which once befell the eloquent Abbe Bautain,
who, on ascending the pulpit to preach before the French
King and Court, found that he had forgotten subject, plan,
and text. This method is honest and unobjectionable,
for the notes of the plan are either not used by the
speaker at all, or if he takes them from his pocket, the
people will understand the action.</p>

<p class='c000'>The only remaining method, and that which we would
urge upon every extempore speaker, is to commit the
plan, as sketched, to memory. It is put in the best possible
shape for the expression of the subject by the labor
which has been previously bestowed upon it, and now
such review as will give the mind a perfect recollection of
the whole subject in its orderly unfolding is just what
is needed for final mastery. Previously much of the work
of preparation was given to detached fragments. Now
the subject as a whole is spread out. The time given to
a thorough memorizing of the plan need not be great;
it will indeed be but small if the plan itself is so well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>arranged that every preceding part suggests what follows;
but it will be the most fruitful of all the time
spent in preparation. It puts you in the best condition
for speaking. The object is then fixed in the heart and
will fire it to earnestness and zeal, while the subject is
spread, like a map, before the mental vision. All the
power you possess can then be brought to bear directly
upon the people. Do not fear that in the hurry of discourse
you will forget some part of what is clear when
you begin. If you are in good mental and physical
condition, the act of speech will be exhilarating and stimulating,
so that every fine line of preparation will come
into clearness just at the right time, and many a relation
unperceived before, many a forgotten fact, will spring up
in complete and vivid perception. There is a wonderful
luxury of feeling in such speech. Sailing with a swift
wind, riding a race-horse, even the joy of victorious battle—indeed,
all enjoyments that arise from the highest
powers called forth into successful exercise—are inferior
to the thrill and intoxication of the highest form of successful
extemporaneous speech. To think of using notes
then would seem like a contemptible impertinence!
Imagine Xavier or Luther with their notes spread out
before them, looking up the different items from which
to address the multitudes spell-bound before them! The
Presbyterian Deacon who once prayed in the presence of
his note-using Pastor, “O Lord! teach Thy servants to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>speak from the heart to the heart, and not from a little
piece of paper, as the manner of some is,” was not so
very far wrong!</p>

<p class='c000'>It is advisable to commit the plan to memory a considerable
time before speaking. It then takes more
complete possession of the mind and there is less liability
of forgetting some portion. This is less important when
the subject is perfectly familiar, for then “out of the
abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh,” but those
subjects which have been recently studied for the first
time are in a different position; and some meditation
upon that which has just been arranged in its best form
will be very serviceable. Even if the salient points are
firmly grasped, some of the minor parts may require
further close consideration. No study is ever so profitable
as that which is bestowed after the plan is complete,
for up to that time there is danger that some of the
thoughts to which our attention is given may be ultimately
rejected and others radically modified. But
when the plan is finished each idea has settled into its
place. If obscurity rests anywhere, it may be detected
at once, and the strength of the mind be brought to bear
for its banishment. Impressions derived from meditation
are then easily retained until the hour of speech,
because associated with their proper place in the prepared
outline. Such deep meditation on each division of the
discourse can scarcely fail to make it original in the true
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>sense of the term, and weave all its parts together with
strong and massive thoughts.</p>

<p class='c000'>After the plan has been memorized we can meditate
upon it not only at the desk, but anywhere. As we
walk about or lie in bed, or at any other time find our
minds free from distractions, we can ponder the ideas
that cluster around our subject until they grow perfectly
familiar. Even when we are reading or thinking on
other topics, brilliant thoughts will not unfrequently
spring up, or those we possessed before take stronger
and more definite outlines. All such gains can be held
in memory without the use of the pen, because the plan
furnishes a suitable place for them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The course here described we would urge strongly
upon the consideration of the young speaker. If carefully
followed, its results will be invaluable. Arrange
the plan from which you are to speak as clearly as may
be in the form of a brief sketch; turn it over and over
again; ponder each idea and the manner of bringing it
out; study the connection between all the parts until
the whole from beginning to end appears perfectly plain
and simple. So frequently has this mode of preparation
been tested that its effectiveness is no longer a matter of
experiment.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is advantageous to grasp the whole subject, as
early as possible, in a single idea—in the same manner
in which the future tree is compressed within the germ
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>from which it is to spring. Then this one thought will
suggest the entire discourse to the speaker, and at its
conclusion will be left clear and positive in the hearer’s
mind. For some acute auditors this may be less necessary.
They are able to outrun a loose speaker, arrange
his scattered fragments, supply his omissions, and arrive
at the idea which has not yet formed itself clearly in his
own mind. Such persons often honestly commend
orators who are incomprehensible to the majority of
their hearers. But the opinions of such auditors are an
unsafe guide, for they form a very small minority of
any assembly.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is one further step which may sometimes precede
the moment of speech with profit—the placing upon
paper of a brief but connected sketch or statement of the
whole discourse. If this is made in the ordinary writing
there is danger that its slowness will make it more of a
word-study than what it is intended to be—a test of
ideas. A thorough mastery of shorthand, or the service
of some one who has such mastery, will supply this
defect. If the plan is well arranged there will be no
pause in the most rapid composition, and if the whole
discourse can at one effort be thrown into a dress of
words there may be full assurance that the same thing
can be accomplished still more easily and effectively
when the additional stimulus of an audience is supplied.
There should be no attempt, in the moment of speaking,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>to recall the very words used in writing, but the command
of language will undoubtedly be greatly improved
by having so recently used many of the terms that will
be again required. Frequently there will be fine passages
in the speech which you have thus struck off at
white heat that you may be unwilling to forget, but it is
better to make no effort to remember them, for you are
almost sure to rise still higher in the moment of
public delivery.</p>

<p class='c000'>When this rapid writing is not available, a partial
substitute for it may be found in writing in the ordinary
hand a brief sketch or compact model of the whole discourse.
You will be surprised to notice how short a
compass will suffice for a discourse requiring an hour or
more in delivery, without the omission of a single
material thought. Such a sketch differs from the plan
in clearly expressing all the ideas that underlie the
coming speech, while the latter would be nearly unintelligible
to any but its author. The one is only a few
marks thrown out in the field of thought by which an
intended pathway is indicated; the other is a very brief
view of the thoughts themselves, without adornment or
verbiage. Some speakers who might feel insecure in
trusting the notes and hints of the plan would feel perfectly
safe in enlarging upon a statement of their
thoughts so brief that the whole sketch of the speech
would not require more than three or four minutes to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>read. But this whole plan of writing, either in full
or in brief, is only an expedient, and need not be adopted
by those who have full confidence in their trained and
cultivated powers.</p>

<p class='c000'>After you have prepared your plan it is well to preserve
it for future use, which may be done by copying
it into a book kept for that purpose: or, what is more
convenient in practice, folding the slip of paper on which
it is written into an envelope of suitable size with the
subject written on the back. These may be classified
and preserved, even in very large numbers, so as to be
easily consulted. From time to time, as your ability
grows, they may be improved upon so as to remain the
complete expression of your ability on every theme treated.
On the back of the envelope may also be written references
to any source of additional information on the
same subject, and printed or written scraps, valuable as
illustrations, or for additional information, may be
slipped inside.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>Having completed all your preparations, you now
anxiously await the commencement of the intellectual
battle. This period is often a severe trial. Men who
are physically brave sometimes tremble in anticipation of
speedily standing before an audience. The shame of
failure then may appear worse than death itself. As the
soldier feels more of cold and shrinking terror when
listening for the peal of the first gun, than afterward,
when the conflict deepens into blood around him, so the
speaker usually suffers more in this moment of expectancy
than in any that follows. You behold the danger
in its full magnitude, without the inspiration that attends
it. Yet whatever effort it may cost, you must remain
calm and collected, for if not master of yourself, you
cannot expect to rule others. Your material must be
kept well in hand, ready to be used at the proper time,
though it is not well to be continually conning over your
preparation. That would destroy the freshness of your
matter and bring you to the decisive test weary and
jaded. You only need such an occasional glance as will
assure you that all your material remains within reach.
It is seldom possible by any means to banish all fear,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>and it is to the speaker’s advantage that he cannot. His
timidity arises from several causes, which differ widely
in the effects they produce. A conscious want of preparation,
especially when this arises from any neglect or
indolence, is one of the most distressing sources of fear.
A species of remorse then mingles with the embarrassment
natural to the moment. If the speaker has no
other motive than to win reputation—to minister to his
own vanity—he will feel terrified, as he realizes that
shame instead of honor may be the result of his rashness.
That man is fortunate who can say, “I only
speak because I feel it to be duty which I dare not
refuse—a work that I must perform whether well or
ill.” The lawyer who must defend his client, the minister
who feels that the hour of service has arrived, the
teacher in the presence of his class, are examples of those
who speak under the same kind of compulsion that calls
a field laborer out into the burning heat of a July noon
whether he feels like it or not. But if you are about to
speak because you have intruded into the work that
properly belongs to another, you need to be very sure of
your preparation, for in case of failure you will not have
even your own sympathy.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the most formidable and common foe of the
speaker’s, in these preliminary moments, is a general
dread that can neither be analyzed nor accounted for.
Persons who have never felt its power sometimes make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>light of it, but experience will change their views. The
soldier who has never witnessed a battle, or felt the air
throb with the explosion of cannon, or heard the awful
cries of the wounded, is often a great braggart; while
“the scarred veteran of a hundred fights” never speaks
of the carnival of blood without shuddering, and would
be the last, but for the call of duty, to brave the danger
he knows so well. There may be a few speakers who
do not feel such fear, but it is because they do not know
what true speaking is. They have never known the full
tide of inspiration which sometimes lifts the orator far
above his conceptions, but which first struggles in his
own bosom like the pent fires of a volcano. They only
come forward to relieve themselves of the interminable
stream of twaddle that wells spontaneously to their lips,
and can well be spared the pangs preceding the birth of
a powerful and living discourse.</p>

<p class='c000'>This kind of fear belongs to every kind of oratory, but
is most intense on those great occasions, in presence of
large audiences, when men’s passions run high. In mere
instructive address, where the ground has been repeatedly
gone over and where the effort is mainly of an intellectual
character, it is less noticeable. It resembles the awe
felt on the eve of all great enterprises, and when excessive,
as it is in some highly gifted minds, it constitutes an
absolute bar to public speech. But in most cases it is a
source of inspiration rather than of repression.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>There is a strange sensation often experienced in the
presence of an audience. It may proceed from the gaze
of the many eyes that turn upon the speaker, especially
if he permits himself to steadily return that gaze. Most
speakers have been conscious of this in a nameless thrill,
a real something, pervading the atmosphere, tangible,
evanescent, indescribable. All writers have borne testimony
to the power of a speaker’s eye in impressing an
audience. This influence which we are now considering
is the reverse of that picture—the power <em>their</em> eyes may
exert upon him, especially before he begins to speak:
after the inward fires of oratory are fanned into flame
the eyes of the audience lose all terror. By dwelling
on the object for which we speak and endeavoring to
realize its full importance, we will in a measure lose
sight of our personal danger, and be more likely to
maintain a calm and tranquil frame of mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>No change should be made in the plan at the last
moment, as that is very liable to produce confusion.
This error is often committed. The mind has a natural
tendency to go repeatedly over the same ground, revising
and testing every point, and it may make changes the consequences
of which cannot be in a moment foreseen. But
the necessary preparation has been made and we should
now await the result calmly and hopefully. Over-study
is quite possible, and when accompanied by great solicitude
wearies our mind in advance and strips the subject
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>of all freshness. If the eye is fixed too long upon one
object with a steadfast gaze, it loses the power to see at
all. So the mind, if exerted steadily upon a single topic
for a long period, fails in vigor and elasticity at the
moment when those qualities are indispensable. That
profound thinker and preacher, Frederick W. Robertson,
experienced this difficulty and was accustomed to find
relief by reading some inspiring paragraphs upon some
totally different theme from that he intended to speak
about. The energy and enthusiasm of our minds in
the moment of speech must be raised to the highest
pitch; the delivery of a living discourse is not the dry
enumeration of a list of particulars; but we must
actually feel an immediate and burning interest in the
topics with which we deal. This cannot be counterfeited.</p>

<p class='c000'>To clearly arrange all thoughts that belong to the
subject, lay them aside when the work is done until the
moment of speech, and then enter confidently upon them
with only such a momentary glance as will assure us
that all is right—this is the method to make our strength
fully available. This confidence while in waiting seems
to the beginner very difficult, but experience rapidly
renders it easy. M. Bautain declares that he has been
repeatedly so confident in his preparation as to fall
asleep while waiting to be summoned to the pulpit!</p>

<p class='c000'>Those who misimprove the last moments by too much
thought and solicitude are not the only class of offenders.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>Some persons, through mere indolence, suffer the
fine lines of preparation which have been traced with so
much care to fade into dimness. This error is not unfrequently
committed by those who speak a second or
third time on the same subject. Because they have once
succeeded they imagine that the same success is always
at command. No mistake could be greater. It is not
enough to have speech-material in a position from which
it can be collected by a conscious and prolonged effort,
but it must be in the foreground of the mind. There is
no time at the moment of delivery for reviving half
obliterated lines of memory.</p>

<p class='c000'>The writer once saw a notable case of failure from
this cause. A preacher on a great occasion was much
engrossed with other important duties until the hour
appointed for his sermon had arrived. With perfect
confidence he selected a sketch from which he had
preached a short time before and with the general course
of which he was no doubt familiar. But when he
endeavored to produce his thoughts they were not ready.
He became embarrassed, talked at random for a short
time, and then had the candor to tell the audience that
he could not finish, and to take his seat. Probably half
an hour given to reviewing his plan would have made
all his previous preparation fresh again, and have spared
him the mortification of failure.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this last interval it is also well to care for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>strength and vigor of the body, as its condition greatly
influences all mental operations. It is said that the
pearl-diver, before venturing into the depths of the sea,
always spends a few moments in deep breathing and
other bodily preparations. In the excitement of speech,
the whirl and hurricane of emotion, it is advisable to
be well prepared for the high tension of nerve that is
implied. Mental excitement exhausts and wears down
the body faster than bodily labor. We must carefully
husband our strength that we may be able to meet all
demands upon it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Holyoake makes the following pertinent observation
in reference to this point:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perhaps the lowest quality of the art of oratory,
but one on many occasions of the <em>first importance</em>, is a
certain robust and radiant physical health; great volumes
of animal heat. In the cold thinness of a morning
audience mere energy and mellowness is inestimable;
wisdom and learning would be harsh and unwelcome
compared with a substantial man, who is quite a housewarming.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Fatiguing and excessive exercise should be very carefully
avoided. Holyoake illustrates this from his own
experience. He says:</p>

<p class='c000'>“One Saturday I walked from Sheffield to Huddersfield
to deliver on Sunday two anniversary lectures. It
was my first appearance there, and I was ambitious to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>acquit myself well. But in the morning I was utterly
unable to do more than talk half inaudibly and quite
incoherently. In the evening I was tolerable, but my
voice was weak. My annoyance was excessive. I was
a paradox to myself. My power seemed to come and go
by some eccentric law of its own. I did not find out
until years after that the utter exhaustion of my strength
had exhausted the powers of speech and thought, and
that entire repose, instead of entire fatigue, should have
been the preparation for public speaking.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The last statement is somewhat too strong, for absolute
rest is not generally advisable. It would leave the
speaker, when he began to speak, with languid mind and
slowly beating pulse—a state which it would require
some minutes for him to overcome. A short, but brisk
walk, when the health is good, will invigorate and refresh
all his faculties, and often prevent a listless introduction
by giving him the vigor to grasp the subject at once and
launch right into the heart of it. Should any person
doubt the power of exercise to produce this effect, let
him, when perplexed with difficult questions in his study,
start out over fields and hills, and review the matter in
the open air. It is a good thing to carry the breath of
the fields into the opening of our addresses.</p>

<p class='c000'>But when the speaker cannot take this form of exercise
in the moments just preceding speech, he may easily
find a substitute for it. If alone, he can pace back and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>forth and swing his arms until the circulation becomes
brisk and pours a stream of arterial blood to the brain.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another simple exercise can be practiced anywhere,
and will be of great benefit. Many persons injure
themselves by speaking too much from the throat. This
is caused by improper, short, and shallow breathing.
To breathe properly is beneficial at any time, and does
much to prevent or remedy throat and lung<a id='t142'></a> disease.
But in the beginning of a speech it is doubly important:
when once under way, there will be no time to think of
either voice or breath: the only safe plan, then, is to have
the right mode made habitual and instinctive. This
will be greatly promoted if just before beginning we
breathe deeply for a few minutes, inflating the lungs to
their extremities and sending the warm blood to the very
tips of the fingers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having now done all we can in advance, nothing remains
but to rise and speak. Preparation and precaution
are passed. Actual work—the most joyous, thrilling,
and spiritual of all human tasks—is now to be entered
upon.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVII.<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>The Introduction.</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The time for the speech having arrived, we will now
consider its separate parts. No division is better for our
purpose than that employed in a previous part of this
work—a three-fold division into introduction, discussion,
and conclusion.</p>

<p class='c000'>A good introduction is exceedingly valuable, and is to
be sought for with great solicitude, if it does not spontaneously
present itself. Some kind of an introduction
is inevitable, for there will always be a first moment
when silence is broken, and our thoughts introduced.
The subsiding murmur of the audience tells the speaker
that the time of his trial has come. If he is very sensitive,
or if he has seldom, if ever, spoken before, his
pulse beats fast, his face flushes, and an indescribable
feeling of faintness and fear thrills every nerve. He
may wish himself anywhere else, but there is now no
help for him. He must arise, and for the time stand as
the mark for all eyes and the subject of all thoughts.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is a vast difference between reciting and extemporizing
in these opening moments, and the advantage
seems to be altogether on the side of recitation. Every
word is in its proper place and the speaker may be perfectly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>calm and self-collected. He is sure that his
memory will not fail him in the opening, and encouraged
by that assurance, will usually throw his whole power
into his first sentences, causing his voice to ring clear
and loud over the house.</p>

<p class='c000'>The extemporizer is in a far more difficult position.
He is sure of nothing. The weight of the whole speech
rests heavily upon his mind. He is glancing ahead,
striving to forecast the coming sentences, as well as
carrying forward those gliding over the tongue, and, distracted
by this double labor, his first expressions may be
feeble and ungraceful. Yet this modesty and timidity is
no real loss: it goes far to conciliate an audience and
secure their good-will. We can scarcely fail to distinguish
memorized from extemporized discourses by
the introduction alone.</p>

<p class='c000'>To avoid the pain and hesitancy of an unelaborated
beginning, some speakers write and memorize the opening
passage. This may accomplish the immediate object,
but it is apt to be at the expense of all the remainder of
the discourse. The mind cannot pass easily from reciting
to spontaneous origination; and the voice, being too freely
used at first, loses its power. The hearers, having listened
to highly polished language, are less disposed to
relish the plain words that follow, and the whole speech,
which, like the Alpine condor, may have pitched from
the loftiest summits, falls fast and far, until the lowest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>level is reached. A written introduction may be modest
and unpretending, but unless it very closely imitates
unstudied speech, painful contrasts and disappointments
are inevitable.</p>

<p class='c000'>One mode of avoiding these difficulties is to make no
formal introduction, but to plunge at once into the heart of
the subject. Sometimes, when the minds of speaker and
hearer are already absorbed by the same general topic,
as in the midst of a heated political canvass, this mode
is very good. Under such circumstances, an interest
may soon be aroused which removes all embarrassment.
But usually the speaker’s mind is full of a subject which
is unfamiliar and indifferent to his hearers. It then
behooves him to find some mode of gaining their attention
and sympathy before he takes the risk of arousing
a prejudice against his subject which he might afterward
strive in vain to overcome. If something is found which
can be made to bear some relation to his subject, without
too violent straining, and which already excites interest
in their minds, it will be far better to begin with that,
and lead them to the proper theme when their attention
has been thoroughly aroused.</p>

<p class='c000'>The introduction should not be left to the chance of
the moment. It may often, with great propriety, be
prepared after all other parts of the speech are planned.
But with even more care than is given to any other portion
should the introduction be prearranged. When
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>once the wings of eloquence are fully spread we may soar
above all obstructions; but in starting it is well to be
assured that the ground is clear about us.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is only the substance and not the words of the introduction
that should be prepared. A single sentence
may be mentally forecast, but much beyond would be
harmful; and even this sentence should be simple
and easily understood. Anything that needs explanation
is very much out of place. Neither should the
introduction be so striking as to be the part of the discourse
longest remembered. Rather than permit the
attention to be distracted in that manner, it would be
better to have no introduction.</p>

<p class='c000'>A speaker gains much if he can at the outset arrest
the attention and win the sympathy of his hearers and
then carry these over to his proper subject. But it may
be assumed as certain, that no kind of an apology will
accomplish this object—unless, indeed, the speaker is
such a favorite that everything in regard to his health
or position is an object of deep solicitude to his audience.
A popular speaker who happens to be late and apologizes
for it by explaining that he had just escaped from a terrible
railroad accident would make a good introduction. A
loved pastor, in his first sermon after serious illness,
might properly begin by talking of his amendment and
his joy at addressing Ins flock again. But these are rare
exceptions. The speaker about to make any kind of an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>apology or personal reference as an introduction, may
well heed <em>Punch’s advice to persons about to be married</em>:
“Don’t.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In many instances it is not easy to get the mere attention
of an audience. They come together from many
different employments with thoughts engaged upon
various topics, and it is difficult to remove distracting
influences and fix all minds upon one subject. Sometimes
a startling proposition, in the nature of a challenge,
will secure the object. Earnestness in the speaker goes
far toward it. But above everything else, sameness and
monotony must be carefully avoided. When the same
audience is frequently addressed, variety becomes essential.
The writer knew of a minister who made it a
rule to consider the nature, reason, and manner of his
subjects, in answer to the supposed questions: “What
is it? Why is it? How is it?” The eloquence of
Paul could not often have redeemed the faults of such
an arrangement.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some inattention may be expected and patiently borne
with at first. Part of the opening words may be lost—an
additional reason for not making them of capital importance
to the address. It is useless to try by loud
tones and violent manner to dispel indifference. If the
speaker’s words have real weight, and if his manner indicates
confidence, one by one the audience will listen, until
that electric thrill of sympathy, impossible to describe,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>but which is as evident to the practiced orator as an
accord in music, tells him that every ear is open to his
words, and that his thoughts are occupying every mind.
Then the orator’s power is fully developed, and if himself
and his theme are equal to the occasion it is delightful
to use that power. This silent, pulsating interest is
more to be desired than vehement applause, for it cannot
be counterfeited, and it indicates that the heart of the
assembly has been reached and melted by the fire of
eloquence, and is now ready to be molded into any
desired form.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are two or three general subjects available for
introduction which every speaker would do well to study
carefully, and which will do much to furnish him with
the means of properly approaching his theme. We will
mention the most useful of these, premising that no one
mode should be depended upon to the exclusion of others.</p>

<p class='c000'>A good mode of introduction consists in a compliment
to an audience. When a truthful and manly compliment
can be given it is a most pleasant and agreeable step
toward the good-will of those we address; but if used on
all occasions indiscriminately, it is meaningless; if transparently
false, it is repulsive and disgusting; but when
true, there is no reason why it should not be employed.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are several good introductions of the complimentary
character in the 24th and 26th chapters of Acts.
When the orator, Tertullus, accused Paul, he began by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>skillful, but, from the standpoint of his clients, very insincere
flattery:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and
that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by
thy providence, we accept it always, and in all places,
most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.”</p>

<p class='c000'>No fault can be found with the form of this introduction,
but it was untrue, for the men in whose names it
was made were the very reverse of thankful to the
Roman Governor.</p>

<p class='c000'>Paul was far too skillful to lose the advantage of
beginning his address with a compliment, and too honest
to give a false one. There was one fact over which he
could rejoice. Felix had been long enough in office to
know the ways of his enemies; so Paul uses that as an
effective and truthful compliment, while professing his
own confidence in his cause.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been for
many years a Judge unto this nation, I do the more
cheerfully answer for myself, because that thou mayest
understand.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In the same exquisite combination of truthfulness and
compliment to a bad man, Paul begins his address when
before King Agrippa:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think myself happy, King Agrippa, because I
shall answer for myself this day before thee, touching all
the things whereof I am accused of the Jews; especially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>because I know thee to be expert in all customs and
questions which are among the Jews; wherefore, I beseech
thee to hear me patiently.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It should always be remembered, however, that compliments,
even in the estimation of those complimented,
are only grateful in proportion to their judicious character.
Their hollowness, if insincere, is easily detected
and thoroughly despised.</p>

<p class='c000'>Effective introductions can also be constructed from
those topics of the day which may be supposed to fill all
minds. A few words on such subjects, falling in with
the general current of thought, may easily lead up to the
orator’s special topic. The newspapers may thus furnish
us, especially while some striking event is yet recent,
with the means of arresting the attention of newspaper
readers at our first words.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another good mode of introduction is that of locality.
The people of any town may be presumed familiar with
the objects or events of interest for which their own
place is celebrated. A ludicrous instance of this is narrated
of the eloquent Daniel Webster. He had visited
Niagara Falls and was to make an oration at Buffalo the
same day, but, unfortunately, he sat too long over the
wine after dinner. When he arose to speak, the oratorical
instinct struggled with difficulties, as he declared,
“Gentlemen, I have been to look upon your mag—mag—magnificent
cataract, one hundred—and forty—seven—feet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>high! Gentlemen, Greece and Rome in
their palmiest days never had a cataract one hundred—and
forty—seven—feet high!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Another mode of introduction which may be very useful
under proper restrictions is that of citing some relevant
remark made by an author whose name carries great
weight, or so pointed in itself as to at once arrest attention.
A great picture, some feature of a landscape, a great historical
event, may be cited in the same way. This
method of citation is capable of very wide application.
If the sentiment or impression made by the citation is
directly opposite to that which the speaker wishes to produce
this will increase rather than diminish interest, as
the enjoyment of contrast and controversy is very keen;
but the speaker should feel confident of his ability to
overcome the influence of the citation when thus hostile.
A favorite introduction to abolition lectures in a former
generation was the quotation of some strong and shocking
declaration of the rightfulness or beneficence of slavery.</p>

<p class='c000'>The last mode of introduction we will notice is very
similar in character and may be termed that of perception.
Something has been seen, heard, or imagined by
the speaker, which, because of its simple, tangible character,
is easily grasped, and yet leads by some subtle analogy
to his topic. He has seen a ragged, desolate boy
on the street; he describes that poor fellow to his audience;
and then finds them far more ready to listen to a plea
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>for orphan asylums, for education, for better city government,
for anything which can have any bearing upon
the welfare of the boy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here, then, are five principles upon which appropriate
introductions may be constructed. Many others might
be named, but these cover a wide range and may be very
useful. They are:</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>1.</dt>
    <dd>Compliments.
    </dd>
    <dt>2.</dt>
    <dd>Current Events.
    </dd>
    <dt>3.</dt>
    <dd>Local Allusion.
    </dd>
    <dt>4.</dt>
    <dd>Citations.
    </dd>
    <dt>5.</dt>
    <dd>Things seen, heard, or imagined.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c000'>A great calamity may come to a speaker from a bad
introduction. Speakers who are great in everything else
often fail at this point. Some make their introductions
too complicated, and thus defeat their own end, as surely
as the engineer who gives his railroad such steep grades
that no train can pass over it. Others deliver a string
of mere platitudes and weary their audience from the
beginning.</p>

<p class='c000'>When from these or other causes our address is misbegun,
the consequences may be serious. The thought
settles upon the speaker with icy weight that he is failing.
This conviction paralyzes all his faculties. He
talks on, but grows more and more embarrassed. Incoherent
sentences are stammered out which require painful
explanation to prevent them from degenerating into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>perfect nonsense. The outline of his plan dissolves into
mist. The points he intended to make which seemed
strong and important now look trivial. With little hope
ahead he blunders on. The room grows dark before
him, and in the excess of his misery he longs for the
time when he can close without absolute disgrace. But
alas! the end seems far off, and he searches in vain for
some avenue of escape. There is none. His throat
becomes dry and parched, and command of voice is lost.
The audience grow restive, for they are tortured as well
as the speaker, and if he were malicious and had time to
think about it, he might find some alleviation in that.
No one can help him. At length, in sheer desperation,
he does what he ought to have done long before—simply
stops and sits down—perhaps hurling some swelling
morsel of commonplace, as a parting volley, at the audience—bathed
in sweat, and feeling that he is disgraced
forever! If he is very weak or foolish, he resolves
never to speak again without having every word written
out before him; if wiser, he only resolves, not only to
understand his speech, but how to begin it.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>The passage from the introduction to the discussion
should be made smoothly and gradually. To accomplish
this, and to strike the subject at just the right
angle, continuing all the interest previously excited, is a
most important achievement. A definite object is a great
assistance in this part of the work. If the object is
clearly in view, we go right up to it with no wasted
words, and the people follow our guidance because they
see that we are not proceeding at random. But with no
strong purpose we are apt to steer about our subject
without ever being quite ready to enter upon it. The
more brilliant the introduction the more difficult this
transition will be. But all these difficulties may be
overcome with the aid of a well-constructed plan, and
then all the triumphs of oratory are before us.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is great pleasure in speaking well. An assembly
hanging on the words and thinking the thoughts of a
single man, gives to him the most subtle kind of flattery.
But he must not inhale its fragrance heedlessly, or his
fall will be speedy and disastrous. The triumphs of
oratory are very fascinating—the ability to sway our
fellows at pleasure, to bind them willing captives with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>the strong chain of our thought—produces a delirious
and intoxicating sense of power. But in the best of
instances such achievements are very transient, and unless
taken advantage of at the moment to work our cherished
purposes, the opportunity is lost. Even during a single
address it is hard to maintain the influence of a happy
moment. Speakers sometimes utter a great and noble
thought and the nameless thrill of eloquence is felt, but
some irrelevant phrase or commonplace sentiment dissolves
the charm. To avoid this, the whole discourse
must be animated with some controlling purpose, and in
its general character, tend upward, until its close.</p>

<p class='c000'>The law of climax ought to be carefully considered by
the speaker. There may be more than one culmination of
interest in an address, separated by an interval less absorbing
and powerful, but this decline should only be allowed
in order to prepare a second or third climax grander than
all before. To violate this rule and have a speech
“flatten out” toward its close, is a fearful error. Better
reduce the length of the whole by one-half or three-fourths,
and maintain interest and attention to the end.</p>

<p class='c000'>A few miscellaneous considerations in regard to the
style and manner of the speech may be inserted here as
well as anywhere.</p>

<p class='c000'>Diffuseness is often supposed to be a necessary quality
of extemporaneous speech. Many speakers do fall into
it, but they need not. They are diffuse because they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>are unwilling or unable to say exactly what they mean,
but come near it, and continue their efforts until they
are satisfied. They furnish no clear view of any idea,
but only a kind of twilight illumination. This serious
fault may be overcome in spontaneous speech as
readily as in writing. He who thinks clearly and
forcibly will talk in the same manner. Exquisite finish
and elaborate verbal arrangement are not to be looked
for in off-hand speech, but each idea may be expressed
with great force, vigor, and accuracy of shading.</p>

<p class='c000'>This ability to say precisely what we mean in few
words, and at the first effort, constitutes one of the great
beauties of a spoken style. The hearer is filled with
grateful surprise when some new and living idea is suddenly
placed before him clothed in a single word or
sentence. A diffuse speaker gives so many premonitions
of his thought that the audience have guessed it, and
may even come to believe that they have always known
it, before he has made his formal presentment. Of
course, they are wearied, and never give him credit for
an original conception.</p>

<p class='c000'>If troubled with this fault, frequently forecast what
to say; drive it into the smallest number of vivid,
expressive words; then, without memorizing the language,
reproduce the same thought briefly in the hurry
of speech. If not successful in making it as brief as
before, repeat the effort. This exercise will, in time,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>give the ability to condense. But to exercise it the temptation
to fine language must be overcome. No sentence
should be introduced for mere glitter or sparkle: a
single unnecessary word may require others to justify or
explain it, and thus may ruin a whole discourse. The
danger of showy language in speech is far greater than
in writing, for if the writer be drawn too far away from
his subject he can strike out the offending sentences and
begin again, while the speaker has but one trial. If
beauty lies in his way, well; but if not, he should never
abandon his course to seek it.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have seen many directions for “expanding
thought,” and have heard young speakers admire the
ease and grace of such expansion. But thoughts are
not like medicines which require dilution to be more
palatable. It is better to give the essence of an idea
and go on to something else. There should be clear and
ample expression; condensation carried to the point of
obscurity would be a fault; but nothing more than clearness
is needed. If thoughts are few it is better to delve
for others rather than to attenuate and stretch what we
have.</p>

<p class='c000'>A popular error exists as to the kind of language best
adapted to the purposes of oratory. High-sounding
epithets and Latinized words are considered the fitting
medium of speech. These may overawe ignorant
hearers, but can never strike the chords of living sympathy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>which bind all hearts together. If we use terms
hard to be understood the effort put forth by hearers to
master their meaning is just so much subtracted from the
force of the address. The homely Saxon words that
dwell on the lips of the people will unload their wealth
of meaning in the heart as soon as the sound strikes the
ear. Uncommon words build a barrier around thought;
familiar ones are like a railroad over which it glides
swiftly to its destination.</p>

<p class='c000'>All debased and slang words should be rejected, unless
the speech is to partake of the nature of burlesque:
we do not advocate “the familiarity that breeds contempt:”
this is also a hurtful extreme. The two great
requisites in the use of words are that they should
exactly express our ideas, and that they should be
familiar: the charms of melody and association are
not to be despised, but they are secondary.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every speech should have its strong points, upon
which especial reliance is placed. A skillful general
has his choice battalions reserved to pierce the enemy’s
line at the decisive moment, and win the battle. In both
the physical and the mental contest, it is important to
place these reserves aright that all their weight may be
felt.</p>

<p class='c000'>A crisis occurs in nearly all living addresses—a
moment in which a strong argument or a fervid appeal
will accomplish our purpose—just as a vigorous charge,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>or the arrival of reinforcements, will turn the doubtful
scale of battle. The speaker, from the opening of his
speech, should have his object clearly in view and drive
steadily toward it, and when within reach, put forth his
whole power in a mighty effort, achieving the result for
which the whole speech was devised. If the right
opportunity is neglected it seldom returns, and an hour’s
talk may fail to accomplish as much as one good burning
sentence thrown in at the right time. Much talk after
the real purpose of an address is accomplished also is
useless and even perilous.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has all along been taken for granted that the
speaker has something worthy to say. Without this a
serious address deserves no success, although under some
circumstances nothing but sound to tickle the ears is
desired. Such speeches are well enough in their way,
but they rank with the performances on the piano by
which a young lady entertains her uncritical visitors.
They cannot be called speeches in any real sense. The fact
that a speaker has a solid and worthy foundation of
knowledge and an adequate purpose gives him confidence.
He knows that if his words are not instinct with music,
and if the pictures of his fancy are not painted in the
brightest colors, he has yet a just claim upon the attention
of his hearers.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is not necessary that the orator’s thoughts should
be exceedingly profound; the most vital truths lie near
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>the surface, within reach of all. But most men do not
dwell long enough upon one subject to master its obvious
features, and when some one does fully gather up and
fairly present what belongs to a worthy theme it is like
a new revelation. A good illustration of this is found
in the sublimity Dean Stanley imparts to the story of
the Exodus of Israel. Few new facts are presented, but
these are so arranged and vivified by a thoughtful mind
that the subject glows into new meaning. The extemporaneous
speaker may have abundant time for such
study of every topic within his range of addresses, and if
he uses it aright, he can soon wield a charm far beyond
any jingling combination of words.</p>

<p class='c000'>When an orator stands before an audience, shall he
expect to overwhelm them by his eloquence? Such
a result is possible but not probable; and it can never be
safely calculated upon. If persons attempt to be greatly
eloquent on all occasions, they are apt to end by becoming
ridiculous. Good sense and solid usefulness are better
objects of endeavor.</p>

<p class='c000'>Any man who studies a subject until he knows more
about it than his neighbors can interest them in a fireside
explanation, if they care for the subject at all: he
tells his facts in a plain style and is understood. Many
persons will listen delighted to a man’s conversation
until midnight, but will fall asleep in ten minutes if he
tries to make a speech to them. In the first case he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span><em>talks</em>, and is simple and unaffected; in the other he <em>speaks</em>
and feels that he must use a style stiffened up for the
occasion.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Henry Clay was asked how he became so eloquent,
he said that he could tell nothing about it; all he
knew was that when he commenced an address he had
only the desire to speak what he had prepared (not
memorized), and adhered to this line of preparation
until he was enwrapped in the subject, and carried away,
he knew not how. This was a good course, for if the
extraordinary inspiration did not come, a good and sensible
speech was secured at any rate.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some of these considerations may be of service if
weighed in advance, but when the speaker once ascends
the platform he must rely on his own tact for the management
of all details. Closely observing the condition
of the audience, and taking advantage of every favoring
element, he moves steadily toward his object. With
an unobstructed road before him, which he has traveled
in thought until it is familiar, he will advance with
ease and certainty. As he looks upon interested faces,
new ideas arise, and if fitting, are woven into harmony
with previous preparations, often with thrilling
effect. Each emotion enkindled by sympathy embodies
itself in words that move the heart as prepared language
could not do, and each moment his own conviction sinks
deeper into the hearts of his hearers.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>There are three principal ways of concluding a speech.
One of the most graceful is to condense a clear view of
the whole argument and tendency of the address into a
few words, and leave the summing up thus made to produce
its own effect. Discourses aiming principally to
produce conviction may very well be concluded in this
manner. To throw the whole sweep of an argument,
every point of which has been previously elaborated,
into a few telling sentences will contribute powerfully to
make the impression permanent.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another and very common mode is to close with an
application or with practical remarks. When the address
is a sermon, this form of closing is frequently termed an
exhortation, and the whole speech is made to bear upon
the duty of the moment. The conclusion should be
closely connected with the remainder of the address: if
it be so general in character as to fit any speech it will be
of little service to any.</p>

<p class='c000'>A conclusion should always be short and contain no new
matter. Few things are more disastrous than the practice
of drawing toward an end and then launching out
into a new discussion. All good things that have been
said, all previous favorable impressions, are obliterated
by this capital fault. We should be careful to finish the
discussion of our theme before we indicate that the conclusion
has been reached. And if, at the moment of
finishing, we happen to think of anything, however
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>vital, which has been omitted, it had better be left to
another time and place altogether.</p>

<p class='c000'>A third method of closing is to simply break off when
the last item is finished. The full development of the discourse
is thus made its ending, care being taken that the
last item discussed shall be of weight and dignity. This
is by no means the easiest form of conclusion, but rightly
managed it is one of the most effective.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIX.<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>After the Speech.</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>When a fervent and successful discourse has been concluded
there comes a feeling of inexpressible relief. The
burden of an important speech rests with accumulating
force upon the mind from the time the subject is chosen
until it becomes well-nigh intolerable. When speech
actually begins every power is called into play and exerted
to its utmost capacity. The excitement of the
conflict hurries the speaker on, and although he may not
at the time realize the gigantic exertions put forth, yet
when he pauses at length, perhaps exhausted, but with
the victory won, the sense of rest, relief, and security, is
exceedingly delightful.</p>

<p class='c000'>After such an effort both mind and body do need rest.
There are speakers who profess to feel no fatigue after
an hour’s labor, but these are seldom in the front rank
of orators. If the soul has been aroused and all the
man’s faculties bent to the accomplishment of a great
purpose, relaxation is often followed by a sense of utter
prostration. Nothing better for the moment can be
advised than to abandon one’s self to the luxury of utter
repose. Social intercourse and all distractions should as
far as possible be avoided. If circumstances permit, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>short sleep, if but for a few minutes, will afford great
relief; and in most cases sleep will come if wisely
courted.</p>

<p class='c000'>After resting, it is well to ponder closely the lessons
derived from each new experience in speaking. To indulge
in exultation over success or to lament over failure
is not profitable. The speaker is not a perfect judge
of either. He has probably done the best he could at
the time, and there the case should rest, except so far as
he sees the need or the means of future improvement.</p>

<p class='c000'>But judgment of success or failure cannot easily be
avoided. If the speaker’s standard is low, he may pass
beyond it without accomplishing anything worthy of
high praise: or if he is despondent in nature he may
have expected little and may now feel correspondingly
elated because he has exceeded his very moderate expectations.
But it is a curious fact that speakers are often
least pleased with their best speeches. In the mightiest
efforts of the mind the standard is placed very high—perhaps
beyond the possibility of attainment—and the
speaker works with his eyes fixed upon that summit,
and probably, after all his exertions, sees it shining still
far above him. His ideas are but half expressed; he
is mortified that there should be such a difference
between conception and realization. But his hearers
have been led over untrodden fields of thought, and
knowing nothing of the grander heights still above the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>orator’s head, they are naturally filled with enthusiasm,
and cannot enter into the feelings of the speaker if he is
foolish enough to tell them of his disappointment.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is the reason that we are least able to judge of
the success of speeches that have been long meditated
and thoroughly prepared. The subject expands as we
study, its outlines becoming grander and vaster until they
pass beyond our power of adequate representation. Each
separate thought in the whole discussion that is fully
mastered becomes familiar, and is not, therefore, valued
at its true worth. Sometimes, when we begin to speak
with little thought, intending to give only easy and
common views of the subject, everything appears fresh
before us, and if some striking ideas arise, their novelty
gives them three-fold value, and we imagine that we
have made a great speech. All this constitutes no argument
against diligent preparation, but it should stimulate
us to bring up our powers of expression more nearly
to the level of our conceptions.</p>

<p class='c000'>There should never be extreme discouragement over
an apparent failure. Some good end may be reached
even by a very poor speech. One evening the writer
preached when weary and almost unprepared. From
first to last the effort was painful, and to prevent absolute
failure the intended plan had to be abandoned, and
detached thoughts from any source thrown in. Yet
that discourse, which was scarcely worthy of the name,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>elicited warmer approval and did more apparent good
than any one preached for several previous months.
One or two fortunate illustrations redeemed every defect,
so far as the audience (but not the speaker) was concerned.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whatever judgment we may entertain of our own
performances, it is not usually wise to tell our hearers,
or to ask their opinions. Criticisms spontaneously
offered need not be repulsed, but all seeking for commendation
is childish or disgusting. It is sweet to hear
our efforts praised, and most of men can bear an amount
of flattery addressed to themselves which would be insufferable
if offered to others; but this disposition, if
much indulged, becomes ungovernable and exposes us to
well-deserved ridicule. It is pitiable to see a man who
has been uttering wise and eloquent words afterward
stooping to beg crusts of indiscriminating flattery from
his hearers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whenever there is a probability that any discourse
will be repeated, it is well to review it soon after delivery,
while its impression is still fresh upon the mind,
and if any defect appears, amend it in the plan, and add
to the same plan all the valuable ideas that have been
suggested during the speech or afterward. In this
manner we keep each discourse up to the high watermark
of our ability.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some orators are accustomed to write their speeches
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>out in full after delivery. When the theme is important
and time permits, this is a good exercise, but in many—perhaps
the majority of cases—the labor would outweigh
the profit.</p>

<p class='c000'>No such objection applies to reviewing and correcting
a verbatim report of our speeches. To many speakers
such a review of the exact words they have uttered
would be a striking and not altogether pleasing revelation.
Pet phrases, which might otherwise be unnoticed
for years; faults of expression, and especially the profuseness
of words, in which extemporaneous speakers are
tempted to indulge;—would all be forced upon our notice.
We would be surprised to learn that we could often
write the discourse in one-fourth the words employed in
delivery. To form the habit of thus condensing our
speeches after delivery would have a powerful tendency
toward compacting thought in speech itself. The
only hindrance in applying this capital means of improvement
consists in the difficulty of obtaining such
shorthand reports. Where this cannot be overcome a
part of the advantage may be gained by taking the plan
and from it writing out the same kind of a compact presentation
of the thoughts as uttered. This differs from
writing in full by making no effort to record exact
words or forms of expression, but only to recall from
memory and from the sketch the exact thoughts that
were expressed in the language of the moment. Even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>if the same kind of brief sketch has been made previous
to the act of speech, this does not take the place of what
we now recommend; for the former outline may have
been greatly modified by the experience of delivery.</p>

<p class='c000'>In whatever form the best result of the discourse is
recorded, great care should be taken in its preservation.
The plan, sketch, or fully written discourse may be
slipped into an envelope (which may also contain all
illustrative scraps, notes, or references to books that bear
upon the discourse) and on the back may be written the
title, time, and character of delivery, with any other facts
of importance. If the young speaker will faithfully
follow up such a method of recording the results of his
oratorical experience, he will find it one of the best forms
of discipline, and the record itself—carefully indexed,
frequently reviewed, and kept within reasonable bulk—will
in time possess a value greater than gold.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dialogues rendered by young people are always enjoyable, being
relished by the parents and friends as well as by the youthful
performers themselves. This book of dialogues, wholesome in tone,
yet sparkling with wit and full of unexpected and novel situations,
supplies just the material needed. Liberal provision has been
made for anniversary occasions, and for church, school, and home
entertainments. All the matter has been written especially for
this work.</p>

<p class='c000'>The constant demand is for something new and original for
School and Home Entertainments. The authors, from a large
experience, have prepared a book that exactly meets this want.
Novelty and variety mark every page. Dialogues, Tableaux,
Motion Songs, Drills, Shadows, Charades in Pantomime, and
Motion Recitations in Concert represent some of the divisions of
the book. All are adapted to the common school stage and
require but little costume and few properties. Everything is
original and written especially for this work.</p>

<p class='c000'>No form of entertainment has intrenched itself more strongly in
popular favor than Drills and Marches. The authors, with a long
and successful experience in arranging public entertainments, come
with special fitness to their task of writing a book of new and
attractive exercises. The following titles of drills may prove suggestive:
The Broom, Fan, Tambourine, Umbrella, Hoop, Waiter,
Doll, Little Patriots, etc. Full explanations accompany each
drill, so that even in the hands of an inexperienced teacher the
entertainment will prove a success.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is no better way of contributing to the amusement and
enjoyment of a public audience or of the social circle than by
telling a good anecdote or rendering some humorous recitation.
This volume will furnish an abundant supply of both. The recitation,
“Casey at the Bat,” made famous by the celebrated comedian,
DeWolf Hopper, is among the pieces. This selection alone
will be considered by many as worth the cost of the book.</p>

has been prepared with the utmost care, and it will be found as
interesting and attractive for private reading as it is valuable for
public entertainment.</p>

<p class='c000'>If there is anything more enjoyable than a humorous reading or
recitation it is a keen, pointed, humorous dialogue. The compiler,
with the largest resources and widest experience in literature for
entertainment purposes, has produced one of the rarest, brightest,
jolliest books of mirth-provoking dialogues ever published. Much
of the matter was prepared especially for this work. The dialogues
are adapted to old and young of both sexes, and while often keenly
witty, are wholly free from coarseness and vulgarity.</p>

popular scenes judiciously selected from the plays of Shakespeare,
Sheridan, Bulwer, Schiller, and other dramatists, and each

acceptable to audiences of the highest culture and refinement.</p>

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
